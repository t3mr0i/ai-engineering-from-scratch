# Communication Protocols

> Agents that can't speak the same language aren't a team. They're strangers shouting into the void.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** TypeScript
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 (Agent Engineering), Lesson 16.01 (Why Multi-Agent)
**Time:** ~120 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Implement MCP tool discovery and invocation so agents can use tools exposed by external servers
- Build an A2A agent card and task endpoint that allows one agent to delegate work to another over HTTP
- Compare MCP (tool access), A2A (agent-to-agent), ACP (enterprise audit), and ANP (decentralized trust) and explain which protocol solves which problem
- Wire multiple protocols together in a single system where agents discover tools via MCP and delegate tasks via A2A

## The Problem

You split your system into multiple agents. A researcher, a coder, a reviewer. They're great at their individual jobs. But now you need them to actually talk to each other.

Your first attempt is obvious: pass strings around. The researcher returns a blob of text, the coder parses it however it can. It works until the coder misinterprets a research summary, or two agents deadlock waiting for each other, or you need agents built by different teams to collaborate. Suddenly "just pass strings" falls apart.

This is the communication protocol problem. Without a shared contract for how agents exchange information, multi-agent systems are fragile, unauditable, and impossible to scale beyond a handful of agents you personally wrote.

The AI ecosystem has responded with four protocols, each solving a different slice of the problem:

- **MCP** for tool access
- **A2A** for agent-to-agent collaboration
- **ACP** for enterprise auditability
- **ANP** for decentralized identity and trust

This lesson goes deep. You will read real wire formats from each spec, build working implementations, and connect all four into a unified system.

## The Concept

### The Protocol Landscape

Think of these four protocols as layers, each addressing a different question:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  ANP["ANP — How do agents trust strangers?<br/>Decentralized identity (DID), E2EE, meta-protocol"]
  A2A["A2A — How do agents collaborate on goals?<br/>Agent Cards, task lifecycle, streaming, negotiation"]
  ACP["ACP — How do agents talk in auditable systems?<br/>Runs, trajectory metadata, session continuity"]
  MCP["MCP — How does an agent use a tool?<br/>Tool discovery, execution, context sharing"]

  style ANP fill:#f3e8ff,stroke:#7c3aed
  style A2A fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#2563eb
  style ACP fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706
  style MCP fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#059669
```

They're not competitors. They solve different problems at different levels.

### MCP (Recap)

MCP is covered in depth in Phase 13. Quick recap: MCP standardizes how an LLM connects to external tools and data sources. It's a **client-server** protocol where the agent (client) discovers and calls tools exposed by a server.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent (client)
    participant MCP1 as MCP Server<br/>(database, API, files)

    Agent->>MCP1: list tools
    MCP1-->>Agent: tool definitions
    Agent->>MCP1: call tool X
    MCP1-->>Agent: result
```

MCP is **agent-to-tool** communication. It doesn't help agents talk to each other.

### A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol)

**Created by:** Google (now under Linux Foundation as `lf.a2a.v1`)
**Spec version:** 1.0.0
**Problem:** How do autonomous agents collaborate, negotiate, and delegate tasks to each other?

A2A is the protocol for **peer-to-peer agent collaboration**. Where MCP connects an agent to tools, A2A connects an agent to other agents. Each agent publishes an **Agent Card** at a well-known URL, and other agents discover, negotiate with, and delegate tasks to it.

#### How A2A Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client Agent
    participant Remote as Remote Agent

    Client->>Remote: GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
    Remote-->>Client: Agent Card (skills, modes, security)

    Client->>Remote: POST /message:send
    Remote-->>Client: Task (submitted/working)

    alt Polling
        Client->>Remote: GET /tasks/{id}
        Remote-->>Client: Task status + artifacts
    else Streaming
        Client->>Remote: POST /message:stream
        Remote-->>Client: SSE: statusUpdate
        Remote-->>Client: SSE: artifactUpdate
        Remote-->>Client: SSE: completed
    end
```

#### The Real Agent Card

This is what an A2A Agent Card actually looks like in the wild. Served at `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Research Agent",
  "description": "Searches documentation and summarizes findings",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "supportedInterfaces": [
    {
      "url": "https://research-agent.example.com/a2a/v1",
      "protocolBinding": "JSONRPC",
      "protocolVersion": "1.0"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://research-agent.example.com/a2a/rest",
      "protocolBinding": "HTTP+JSON",
      "protocolVersion": "1.0"
    }
  ],
  "provider": {
    "organization": "Your Company",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": true,
    "pushNotifications": false
  },
  "defaultInputModes": ["text/plain", "application/json"],
  "defaultOutputModes": ["text/plain", "application/json"],
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "web-research",
      "name": "Web Research",
      "description": "Searches the web and synthesizes findings",
      "tags": ["research", "search", "summarization"],
      "examples": ["Research the latest changes in React 19"]
    },
    {
      "id": "doc-analysis",
      "name": "Documentation Analysis",
      "description": "Reads and analyzes technical documentation",
      "tags": ["docs", "analysis"],
      "inputModes": ["text/plain", "application/pdf"],
      "outputModes": ["application/json"]
    }
  ],
  "securitySchemes": {
    "bearer": {
      "httpAuthSecurityScheme": {
        "scheme": "Bearer",
        "bearerFormat": "JWT"
      }
    }
  },
  "security": [{ "bearer": [] }]
}
```

Key things to notice:
- **Skills** are what an agent can do. Each has an ID, tags, and supported input/output MIME types. This is how a client agent decides whether this remote agent can handle its request.
- **supportedInterfaces** lists multiple protocol bindings. A single agent can speak JSON-RPC, REST, and gRPC simultaneously.
- **Security** is built into the card. The client knows what auth it needs before making a single request.

#### Task Lifecycle

Tasks are the core unit of work in A2A. They move through defined states:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted
    submitted --> working
    working --> input_required: needs more info
    input_required --> working: client sends data
    working --> completed: success
    working --> failed: error
    working --> canceled: client cancels
    submitted --> rejected: agent declines

    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
    canceled --> [*]
    rejected --> [*]

    note right of completed
        Terminal states are immutable.
        Follow-ups create new tasks
        within the same contextId.
    end note
```

All 8 states (the spec also defines `UNSPECIFIED` as a sentinel, omitted here):

| State | Terminal? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED` | No | Acknowledged, not yet processing |
| `TASK_STATE_WORKING` | No | Actively being processed |
| `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` | No | Agent needs more info from client |
| `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` | No | Authentication needed |
| `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` | Yes | Finished successfully |
| `TASK_STATE_FAILED` | Yes | Finished with error |
| `TASK_STATE_CANCELED` | Yes | Canceled before completion |
| `TASK_STATE_REJECTED` | Yes | Agent declined the task |

Once a task reaches a terminal state, it's immutable. No further messages. Follow-ups create a new task within the same `contextId`.

#### Wire Format

A2A uses JSON-RPC 2.0. Here's what a real message exchange looks like:

**Client sends a task:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "SendMessage",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "messageId": "msg-001",
      "role": "ROLE_USER",
      "parts": [{ "text": "Research React 19 compiler features" }]
    },
    "configuration": {
      "acceptedOutputModes": ["text/plain", "application/json"],
      "historyLength": 10
    }
  }
}
```

**Agent responds with a task:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "task": {
      "id": "task-abc-123",
      "contextId": "ctx-xyz-789",
      "status": {
        "state": "TASK_STATE_COMPLETED",
        "timestamp": "2026-03-27T10:30:00Z"
      },
      "artifacts": [
        {
          "artifactId": "art-001",
          "name": "research-results",
          "parts": [{
            "data": {
              "findings": [
                "React 19 compiler auto-memoizes components",
                "No more manual useMemo/useCallback needed",
                "Compiler runs at build time, not runtime"
              ]
            },
            "mediaType": "application/json"
          }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Streaming via SSE:**
```text
POST /message:stream HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
A2A-Version: 1.0

data: {"task":{"id":"task-123","status":{"state":"TASK_STATE_WORKING"}}}

data: {"statusUpdate":{"taskId":"task-123","status":{"state":"TASK_STATE_WORKING","message":{"role":"ROLE_AGENT","parts":[{"text":"Searching documentation..."}]}}}}

data: {"artifactUpdate":{"taskId":"task-123","artifact":{"artifactId":"art-1","parts":[{"text":"partial findings..."}]},"append":true,"lastChunk":false}}

data: {"statusUpdate":{"taskId":"task-123","status":{"state":"TASK_STATE_COMPLETED"}}}
```

### ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)

**Created by:** IBM / BeeAI
**Spec version:** 0.2.0 (OpenAPI 3.1.1)
**Status:** Merging into A2A under the Linux Foundation
**Problem:** How do agents communicate with full auditability, session continuity, and trajectory tracking?

ACP is the **enterprise protocol**. Unlike what many summaries claim, ACP does **not** use JSON-LD. It's a straightforward REST/JSON API defined via OpenAPI. What makes it special is **TrajectoryMetadata**: every agent response can carry a detailed log of the reasoning steps and tool calls that produced it.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ACP as ACP Agent
    participant Audit as Audit Log

    Client->>ACP: POST /runs (mode: sync)
    ACP->>ACP: Process request...
    ACP->>Audit: Log trajectory:<br/>reasoning + tool calls
    ACP-->>Client: Response + TrajectoryMetadata
    Note over Audit: Every step recorded:<br/>tool_name, tool_input,<br/>tool_output, reasoning
```

#### Agent Discovery in ACP

ACP defines four discovery methods:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent Discovery] --> B["Runtime<br/>GET /agents"]
    A --> C["Open<br/>.well-known/agent.yml"]
    A --> D["Registry<br/>Centralized catalog"]
    A --> E["Embedded<br/>Container labels"]

    style B fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#2563eb
    style C fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#059669
    style D fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706
    style E fill:#f3e8ff,stroke:#7c3aed
```

The **AgentManifest** is simpler than A2A's Agent Card:

```json
{
  "name": "summarizer",
  "description": "Summarizes documents with source citations",
  "input_content_types": ["text/plain", "application/pdf"],
  "output_content_types": ["text/plain", "application/json"],
  "metadata": {
    "tags": ["summarization", "RAG"],
    "framework": "BeeAI",
    "capabilities": [
      {
        "name": "Document Summarization",
        "description": "Condenses long documents into key points"
      }
    ],
    "recommended_models": ["llama3.3:70b-instruct-fp16"],
    "license": "Apache-2.0",
    "programming_language": "Python"
  }
}
```

#### Run Lifecycle

ACP uses "Runs" instead of "Tasks". A Run is an agent execution with three modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `sync` | Blocking. Response contains the complete result. |
| `async` | Returns 202 immediately. Poll `GET /runs/{id}` for status. |
| `stream` | SSE stream. Events fire as the agent works. |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> created
    created --> in_progress
    in_progress --> completed: success
    in_progress --> failed: error
    in_progress --> awaiting: needs input
    awaiting --> in_progress: client resumes
    in_progress --> cancelling: cancel request
    cancelling --> cancelled

    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
```

#### TrajectoryMetadata (The Audit Trail)

This is ACP's key differentiator. Every message part can include metadata showing exactly what the agent did:

```json
{
  "role": "agent/researcher",
  "parts": [
    {
      "content_type": "text/plain",
      "content": "The weather in San Francisco is 72F and sunny.",
      "metadata": {
        "kind": "trajectory",
        "message": "I need to check the weather for this location",
        "tool_name": "weather_api",
        "tool_input": { "location": "San Francisco, CA" },
        "tool_output": { "temperature": 72, "condition": "sunny" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For regulated industries this is gold. Every answer comes with a provable chain of reasoning: which tools were called, what inputs were used, what outputs were received. No black box.

ACP also supports **CitationMetadata** for source attribution:

```json
{
  "kind": "citation",
  "start_index": 0,
  "end_index": 47,
  "url": "https://weather.gov/sf",
  "title": "NWS San Francisco Forecast"
}
```

### ANP (Agent Network Protocol)

**Created by:** Open-source community (founded by GaoWei Chang)
**Repo:** [github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol](https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol)
**Problem:** How do agents from different organizations trust each other without a central authority?

ANP is the **decentralized identity protocol**. It builds trust using W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and end-to-end encryption. Unlike A2A where you discover agents through known endpoints, ANP lets agents prove their identity cryptographically.

ANP has three layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Layer3["Layer 3: Application Protocol"]
        AD[Agent Description Documents]
        DISC[Discovery endpoints]
    end
    subgraph Layer2["Layer 2: Meta-Protocol"]
        NEG[AI-powered protocol negotiation]
        CODE[Dynamic code generation]
    end
    subgraph Layer1["Layer 1: Identity & Secure Communication"]
        DID["did:wba (W3C DID)"]
        HPKE[HPKE E2EE - RFC 9180]
        SIG[Signature verification]
    end

    Layer3 --> Layer2
    Layer2 --> Layer1

    style Layer1 fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#059669
    style Layer2 fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#2563eb
    style Layer3 fill:#f3e8ff,stroke:#7c3aed
```

#### DID Documents (Real Structure)

ANP uses a custom DID method called `did:wba` (Web-Based Agent). The DID `did:wba:example.com:user:alice` resolves to `https://example.com/user/alice/did.json`:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/secp256k1-2019/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#key-1",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "crv": "secp256k1",
        "x": "NtngWpJUr-rlNNbs0u-Aa8e16OwSJu6UiFf0Rdo1oJ4",
        "y": "qN1jKupJlFsPFc1UkWinqljv4YE0mq_Ickwnjgasvmo",
        "kty": "EC"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#key-x25519-1",
      "type": "X25519KeyAgreementKey2019",
      "controller": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": [
    "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#key-1"
  ],
  "keyAgreement": [
    "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#key-x25519-1"
  ],
  "humanAuthorization": [
    "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#key-1"
  ],
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "did:wba:example.com:user:alice#agent-description",
      "type": "AgentDescription",
      "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/agents/alice/ad.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key things to notice:
- **Key separation** is enforced. Signing keys (secp256k1) are separate from encryption keys (X25519).
- **`humanAuthorization`** is unique to ANP. These keys require explicit human approval (biometric, password, HSM) before use. High-risk operations like fund transfers go through this path.
- **`keyAgreement`** keys are used for HPKE end-to-end encryption (RFC 9180).
- The **service** section links to the Agent Description document.

#### How Trust Works in ANP

ANP does **not** use a web-of-trust or endorsement graph. Trust is bilateral and verified per-interaction:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent A
    participant Domain as Agent A's Domain
    participant B as Agent B

    A->>B: HTTP request + DID + signature
    B->>Domain: Fetch DID document (HTTPS)
    Domain-->>B: DID document + public key
    B->>B: Verify signature with public key
    B-->>A: Issue access token
    A->>B: Subsequent requests use token
    Note over A,B: Trust = TLS domain verification<br/>+ DID signature verification<br/>+ Principle of least trust
```

Trust comes from three sources:
1. **Domain-level TLS** verifies the DID document host
2. **DID cryptographic signatures** verify the agent's identity
3. **Principle of least trust** grants only minimum permissions

There's no gossip-based trust propagation or PageRank scoring. You verify each agent directly through its DID.

#### Meta-Protocol Negotiation

This is ANP's most novel feature. When two agents from different ecosystems meet, they don't need pre-agreed data formats. They negotiate in natural language:

```json
{
  "action": "protocolNegotiation",
  "sequenceId": 0,
  "candidateProtocols": "I can communicate using:\n1. JSON-RPC with hotel booking schema\n2. REST with OpenAPI 3.1 spec\n3. Natural language over HTTP",
  "modificationSummary": "Initial proposal",
  "status": "negotiating"
}
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent A
    participant B as Agent B

    A->>B: protocolNegotiation (candidateProtocols)
    B->>A: protocolNegotiation (counter-proposal)
    A->>B: protocolNegotiation (accepted)
    Note over A,B: Agents dynamically generate code<br/>to handle the agreed format.<br/>Max 10 rounds, then timeout.
```

The agents go back and forth (max 10 rounds) until they agree on a format, then dynamically generate code to handle it. Status values: `negotiating`, `rejected`, `accepted`, `timeout`.

This means two agents that have never seen each other before can figure out how to communicate without anyone pre-defining a shared schema.

### Comparison (Corrected)

| | MCP | A2A | ACP | ANP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Created by** | Anthropic | Google / Linux Foundation | IBM / BeeAI | Community |
| **Spec format** | JSON-RPC | JSON-RPC / REST / gRPC | OpenAPI 3.1 (REST) | JSON-RPC |
| **Primary use** | Agent to Tool | Agent to Agent | Agent to Agent | Agent to Agent |
| **Discovery** | Tool listing | `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | `GET /agents`, `/.well-known/agent.yml` | `/.well-known/agent-descriptions`, DID service endpoints |
| **Identity** | Implicit (local) | Security schemes (OAuth, mTLS) | Server-level | W3C DID (`did:wba`) with E2EE |
| **Audit trail** | N/A | Basic (task history) | TrajectoryMetadata (tool calls, reasoning) | Not formally specified |
| **State machine** | N/A | 9 task states | 7 run states | N/A |
| **Streaming** | N/A | SSE | SSE | Transport-agnostic |
| **Unique feature** | Tool schemas | Agent Cards + Skills | Trajectory audit trail | Meta-protocol negotiation |
| **Best for** | Tools & data | Dynamic collaboration | Regulated industries | Cross-org trust |
| **Status** | Stable | Stable (v1.0) | Merging into A2A | Active development |

### How They Work Together

These protocols are not mutually exclusive. A realistic enterprise system uses multiple:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph org["Your Organization"]
        RA[Research Agent] <-->|A2A| CA[Coding Agent]
        RA -->|MCP| SS[Search Server]
        CA -->|MCP| GS[GitHub Server]
        AUDIT["All agent responses carry<br/>ACP TrajectoryMetadata"]
    end

    subgraph ext["External (DID verified via ANP)"]
        EA[External Agent]
        PA[Partner Agent]
    end

    RA <-->|ANP + A2A| EA
    CA <-->|ANP + A2A| PA

    style org fill:#f8fafc,stroke:#334155
    style ext fill:#fef2f2,stroke:#991b1b
    style AUDIT fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706
```

- **MCP** connects each agent to its tools
- **A2A** handles collaboration between agents (internal and external)
- **ACP** wraps responses in trajectory metadata for auditability
- **ANP** provides identity verification for agents you don't control


## Use It

### Real Implementations

**A2A** is the most mature. Google's [official spec](https://github.com/google/A2A) is open-source under the Linux Foundation. SDKs for Python and TypeScript. If your agents need dynamic discovery and collaboration, start here.

**ACP** is merging into A2A. IBM's [BeeAI project](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp) created ACP as a REST-first alternative, but the trajectory metadata concept is being absorbed into the A2A ecosystem. Use ACP patterns (trajectory logging, run lifecycle) even if you use A2A as the transport.

**ANP** is the most experimental. The [community repo](https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol) has a Python SDK (AgentConnect). The meta-protocol negotiation concept is genuinely novel. Worth watching for cross-organizational agent deployments.

**MCP** is already covered in Phase 13. If you want agents to use tools, MCP is the standard.

| ANP | "Decentralized agent identity" | A community protocol using `did:wba` (DID) for cryptographic identity, HPKE for E2EE, and AI-powered meta-protocol negotiation for agents that have never seen each other. |
| Agent Card | "An agent's business card" | A JSON document at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` describing skills, supported MIME types, security schemes, and protocol bindings. |
| DID | "Decentralized ID" | W3C standard for cryptographically verifiable identities hosted on the agent's own domain. ANP uses `did:wba` method. |
| TrajectoryMetadata | "The audit receipt" | ACP's mechanism for attaching reasoning steps, tool calls, and their inputs/outputs to every agent response. |
| Meta-protocol | "Agents negotiating how to talk" | ANP's approach where agents use natural language to dynamically agree on data formats, then generate code to handle them. |
| Task | "A unit of work" | A2A's stateful object tracking work from submission through completion. Immutable once terminal. |
