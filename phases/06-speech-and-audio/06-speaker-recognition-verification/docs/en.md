# Speaker Recognition & Verification

> ASR asks "what did they say?" Speaker recognition asks "who said it?" The math looks the same — embeddings plus cosine — but every production decision hinges on a single EER number.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 · 02 (Spectrograms & Mel), Phase 5 · 22 (Embedding Models)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## The Problem

A user says a passphrase. You want to know: is this the person they claim to be (*verification*, 1:1), or is it the first person in your enrollment bank (*identification*, 1:N)? Or neither — is this an unknown speaker (*open-set*)?

Pre-2018: GMM-UBM + i-vectors. Reasonable EER but fragile to channel shift (phone vs laptop) and emotion. 2018–2022: x-vectors (TDNN backbone trained with angular margin). 2022+: ECAPA-TDNN and WavLM-large embeddings. By 2026 the field is dominated by three models and one metric.

The metric is **EER** — Equal Error Rate. Set your decision threshold so False Accept Rate = False Reject Rate. The crossover is EER. Used in every paper, every leaderboard, every procurement call.

## The Concept

![Enrollment + verification pipeline with embedding + cosine + EER](../assets/speaker-verification.svg)

**The pipeline.** Enrollment: record 5–30 seconds of the target speaker; compute a fixed-dimension embedding (192-d for ECAPA-TDNN, 256-d for WavLM-large). Verification: get the test utterance embedding; compute cosine similarity; compare to a threshold.

**ECAPA-TDNN (2020, still dominant 2026).** Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation and Aggregation - Time-Delay Neural Network. 1D conv blocks with squeeze-excitation, multi-head attention pooling, followed by a linear layer to 192-d. Trained on VoxCeleb 1+2 (2,700 speakers, 1.1M utterances) with Additive Angular Margin loss (AAM-softmax).

**WavLM-SV (2022+).** Fine-tune a pretrained WavLM-large SSL backbone with AAM loss. Higher quality but slower — 300+ MB vs 15 MB.

**x-vector (baseline).** TDNN + statistics pooling. Classic; still useful on CPU / edge.

**AAM-softmax.** Standard softmax with added margin `m` in the angular space: `cos(θ + m)` for the correct class. Forces inter-class angular separation. Typical `m=0.2`, scale `s=30`.

### Scoring

- **Cosine** between enrollment and test embeddings. Threshold-based decision.
- **PLDA (Probabilistic LDA).** Project embeddings into a latent space where same-speaker vs different-speaker has a closed-form likelihood ratio. Added on top of cosine for +10–20% EER reduction. Standard pre-2020; now used only in closed-set setups.
- **Score normalization.** `S-norm` or `AS-norm`: normalize each score against a cohort of imposter means and stds. Essential for cross-domain eval.

### Numbers you should know (2026)

| Model | VoxCeleb1-O EER | Params | Throughput (A100) |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| x-vector (classic) | 3.10% | 5 M | 400× RT |
| ECAPA-TDNN | 0.87% | 15 M | 200× RT |
| WavLM-SV large | 0.42% | 316 M | 20× RT |
| Pyannote 3.1 segmentation + embedding | 0.65% | 6 M | 100× RT |
| ReDimNet (2024) | 0.39% | 24 M | 100× RT |

### Diarization

"Who spoke when" in a multi-speaker clip. Pipeline: VAD → segment → embed each segment → cluster (agglomerative or spectral) → smooth boundaries. Modern stack: `pyannote.audio` 3.1, which bundles speaker segmentation + embedding + clustering behind one call. 2026 SOTA DER on AMI is ~15% (down from 23% in 2022).
