# Whisper — Architecture & Fine-Tuning

> Whisper is a 30-second-window transformer encoder-decoder, trained on 680k hours of multilingual weakly-supervised audio-text pairs. One architecture, multiple tasks, robust across 99 languages. The 2026 reference ASR.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 · 04 (ASR), Phase 5 · 10 (Attention), Phase 7 · 05 (Full Transformer)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## The Problem

Whisper, released by OpenAI in September 2022, was the first ASR model to ship as a commodity: paste audio, get text, 99 languages, robust to noise, runs on a laptop. By 2024 OpenAI had shipped Large-v3 and Turbo variants; by 2026, Whisper is the default baseline for everything from podcast transcription to voice assistants to YouTube subtitles.

But Whisper is not a pipeline you can treat as a black box forever. Domain shift kills it — technical jargon, speaker accents, proper nouns, short clips, silence. You need to know:

1. What it actually is inside.
2. How to give it chunked, streaming, or long-form audio correctly.
3. When to fine-tune and how.

## The Concept

![Whisper encoder-decoder, tasks, chunked inference, fine-tune](../assets/whisper.svg)

**Architecture.** Standard transformer encoder-decoder.

- Input: 30-second log-mel spectrogram, 80 mels, 10 ms hop → 3000 frames. Clips shorter are zero-padded, clips longer are chunked.
- Encoder: conv-downsample (stride 2) + `N` transformer blocks. For Large-v3: 32 layers, 1280-dim, 20 heads.
- Decoder: `N` transformer blocks with causal self-attn + cross-attn to encoder output. Same size as encoder.
- Output: BPE tokens over a 51,865-token vocab.

Large-v3 has 1.55B params. Turbo uses a 4-layer decoder (from 32), cutting latency 8× with a <1% WER hit.

**The prompt format.** Whisper is a multitask model steered by special tokens in the decoder prompt:

```
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|notimestamps|> Hello world.<|endoftext|>
```

- `<|en|>` — language tag; forces translation-vs-transcription behavior.
- `<|transcribe|>` or `<|translate|>` — translate English output from any-language input, or verbatim.
- `<|notimestamps|>` — skip word-level timestamps (faster).

The prompt is what lets one model do many tasks. Change `<|en|>` to `<|fr|>` and it transcribes French.

**30-second window.** Everything is pinned to 30 seconds. Longer clips need chunking; shorter clips are padded. Windows are not streamed natively — this is why WhisperX, Whisper-Streaming, and faster-whisper exist.

**Log-mel normalization.** `(log_mel - mean) / std` where the stats come from Whisper's own training corpus. You *must* use Whisper's preprocessing (`whisper.audio.log_mel_spectrogram`), not `librosa.feature.melspectrogram`.

### Variants in 2026

| Variant | Params | Latency (A100) | WER (LibriSpeech-clean) |
|---------|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Tiny | 39M | 1× realtime | 5.4% |
| Base | 74M | 1× | 4.1% |
| Small | 244M | 1× | 3.0% |
| Medium | 769M | 1× | 2.7% |
| Large-v3 | 1.55B | 2× | 1.8% |
| Large-v3-turbo | 809M | 8× | 1.58% |
| Whisper-Streaming (2024) | 1.55B | streaming | 2.0% |

### Fine-tuning

Canonical workflow in 2026:

1. Collect 10–100 hours of target-domain audio with aligned transcripts.
2. Run `transformers.Seq2SeqTrainer` with `generate_with_loss` callback.
3. Parameter-efficient: LoRA on `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj` of attention layers reduces GPU memory 4× with <0.3 WER cost.
4. Freeze the encoder if you have <10 hours. Only tune the decoder.
5. Use Whisper's own tokenizer and prompt format; never swap tokenizers.

Community results: fine-tuning Medium on 20 hours of medical dictation drops WER from 12% to 4.5% on medical vocabulary. Fine-tuning Turbo on 4 hours of Icelandic drops WER from 18% to 6%.
