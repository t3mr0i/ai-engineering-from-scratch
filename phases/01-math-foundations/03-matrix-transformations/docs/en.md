# Matrix Transformations

> A matrix is a machine that reshapes space. Learn what it does to every point, and you understand the whole transformation.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python, Julia
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1, Lessons 01-02 (Linear Algebra Intuition, Vectors & Matrices Operations)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Construct rotation, scaling, shearing, and reflection matrices and apply them to 2D and 3D points
- Compose multiple transformations by matrix multiplication and verify that order matters
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 2x2 matrices from the characteristic equation
- Explain why eigenvalues determine PCA directions, RNN stability, and spectral clustering behavior

## The Problem

You read about PCA and see "find the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix." You read about model stability and see "check if all eigenvalues have magnitude less than 1." You read about data augmentation and see "apply a random rotation." None of this makes sense until you understand what matrices do to space geometrically.

Matrices are not just grids of numbers. They are spatial machines. A rotation matrix spins points. A scaling matrix stretches them. A shearing matrix tilts them. Every transformation a neural network applies to data is one of these operations or a composition of them. This lesson makes those operations concrete.

## The Concept

### Transformations as matrices

Every linear transformation in 2D can be written as a 2x2 matrix. The matrix tells you exactly where the basis vectors [1, 0] and [0, 1] end up. Everything else follows.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Standard Basis"]
        e1["e1 = [1, 0] (along x)"]
        e2["e2 = [0, 1] (along y)"]
    end
    subgraph Transform["Matrix M"]
        M["M = columns are new basis vectors"]
    end
    subgraph After["After Transformation M"]
        e1p["e1' = new x-basis"]
        e2p["e2' = new y-basis"]
    end
    e1 --> M --> e1p
    e2 --> M --> e2p
```

### Rotation

A 2D rotation by angle theta keeps distances and angles intact. It moves every point along a circular arc.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Before Rotation"]
        A["A(2, 1)"]
        B["B(0, 2)"]
    end
    subgraph Rot["Rotate 45 degrees"]
        R["R(θ) = [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]]"]
    end
    subgraph After["After Rotation"]
        Ap["A'(0.71, 2.12)"]
        Bp["B'(-1.41, 1.41)"]
    end
    A --> R --> Ap
    B --> R --> Bp
```

In 3D, you rotate around an axis. Each axis has its own rotation matrix:

```
Rz(theta) = | cos  -sin  0 |     Rotate around z-axis
            | sin   cos  0 |     (x-y plane spins, z stays)
            |  0     0   1 |

Rx(theta) = | 1   0     0    |   Rotate around x-axis
            | 0  cos  -sin   |   (y-z plane spins, x stays)
            | 0  sin   cos   |

Ry(theta) = |  cos  0  sin |     Rotate around y-axis
            |   0   1   0  |     (x-z plane spins, y stays)
            | -sin  0  cos |
```

### Scaling

Scaling stretches or compresses along each axis independently.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Before Scaling"]
        A["A(2, 1)"]
        B["B(0, 2)"]
    end
    subgraph Scale["Scale sx=2, sy=0.5"]
        S["S = [[2, 0], [0, 0.5]]"]
    end
    subgraph After["After Scaling"]
        Ap["A'(4, 0.5)"]
        Bp["B'(0, 1)"]
    end
    A --> S --> Ap
    B --> S --> Bp
```

### Shearing

Shearing tilts one axis while keeping the other fixed. It turns rectangles into parallelograms.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Before Shear"]
        A["A(1, 0)"]
        B["B(0, 1)"]
    end
    subgraph Shear["Shear in x, k=1"]
        Sh["Shx = [[1, k], [0, 1]]"]
    end
    subgraph After["After Shear"]
        Ap["A(1, 0) unchanged"]
        Bp["B'(1, 1) shifted"]
    end
    A --> Sh --> Ap
    B --> Sh --> Bp
```

Shear matrices:
- `Shx = [[1, k], [0, 1]]` shifts x by k * y
- `Shy = [[1, 0], [k, 1]]` shifts y by k * x

### Reflection

Reflection mirrors points across an axis or line.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["Before Reflection"]
        A["A(2, 1)"]
    end
    subgraph Reflect["Reflect across y-axis"]
        R["[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]"]
    end
    subgraph After["After Reflection"]
        Ap["A'(-2, 1)"]
    end
    A --> R --> Ap
```

Reflection matrices:
- Reflect across y-axis: `[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]`
- Reflect across x-axis: `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`

### Composition: chaining transformations

Applying transformation A then B is the same as multiplying their matrices: `result = B @ A @ point`. Order matters. Rotate then scale gives different results than scale then rotate.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Path1["Rotate 90 then Scale (2, 0.5)"]
        P1["(1, 0)"] -->|"Rotate 90"| P2["(0, 1)"] -->|"Scale"| P3["(0, 0.5)"]
    end
```

Composed: `S @ R = [[0, -2], [0.5, 0]]`

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Path2["Scale (2, 0.5) then Rotate 90"]
        Q1["(1, 0)"] -->|"Scale"| Q2["(2, 0)"] -->|"Rotate 90"| Q3["(0, 2)"]
    end
```

Composed: `R @ S = [[0, -0.5], [2, 0]]`

Different results. Matrix multiplication is not commutative.

### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Most vectors change direction when a matrix hits them. Eigenvectors are special: the matrix only scales them, never rotates them. The scaling factor is the eigenvalue.

```
A @ v = lambda * v

v is the eigenvector (direction that survives)
lambda is the eigenvalue (how much it stretches)

Example: A = | 2  1 |
             | 1  2 |

Eigenvector [1, 1] with eigenvalue 3:
  A @ [1,1] = [3, 3] = 3 * [1, 1]     (same direction, scaled by 3)

Eigenvector [1, -1] with eigenvalue 1:
  A @ [1,-1] = [1, -1] = 1 * [1, -1]  (same direction, unchanged)
```

The matrix stretches space by 3x along [1, 1] and keeps [1, -1] unchanged. Every other direction is a mix of these two.

### Eigendecomposition

If a matrix has n linearly independent eigenvectors, it can be decomposed:

```
A = V @ D @ V^(-1)

V = matrix whose columns are eigenvectors
D = diagonal matrix of eigenvalues
V^(-1) = inverse of V

This says: rotate into eigenvector coordinates, scale along each axis, rotate back.
```

### Why eigenvalues matter

**PCA.** The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are the principal components. The eigenvalues tell you how much variance each component captures. Sort by eigenvalue, keep the top k, and you have dimensionality reduction.

**Stability.** In recurrent networks and dynamical systems, eigenvalues with magnitude > 1 cause outputs to explode. Magnitude < 1 causes them to vanish. This is the vanishing/exploding gradient problem stated in one sentence.

**Spectral methods.** Graph neural networks use eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. Spectral clustering uses eigenvalues of the Laplacian. The eigenvectors reveal the structure of the graph.

### Determinant as volume scaling factor

The determinant of a transformation matrix tells you how much it scales area (2D) or volume (3D).

```
det = 1:   area preserved (rotation)
det = 2:   area doubled
det = 0:   space crushed to lower dimension (singular)
det = -1:  area preserved but orientation flipped (reflection)

| det(Rotation) | = 1        (always)
| det(Scale sx, sy) | = sx * sy
| det(Shear) | = 1           (area preserved)
| det(Reflection) | = -1     (orientation flipped)
```
