> Every neural network is just matrix multiplication with extra steps.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python, Julia
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1, Lesson 01 (Linear Algebra Intuition)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Build a Matrix class with element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, transpose, determinant, and inverse
- Distinguish element-wise multiplication from matrix multiplication and explain when each applies
- Implement a single dense neural network layer (`relu(W @ x + b)`) using only the from-scratch Matrix class
- Explain broadcasting rules and how bias addition works in neural network frameworks

## The Problem

You want to build a neural network. You read the code and see this:

```
output = activation(weights @ input + bias)
```

That `@` is matrix multiplication. The `weights` are a matrix. The `input` is a vector. If you do not know what those operations do, this line is magic. If you do know, it is the entire forward pass of a layer in three operations.

Every image your model processes is a matrix of pixel values. Every word embedding is a vector. Every layer of every neural network is a matrix transformation. You cannot build AI systems without being fluent in matrix operations the same way you cannot write code without understanding variables.

This lesson builds that fluency from scratch.

## The Concept

### Vectors: ordered lists of numbers

A vector is a list of numbers with a direction and magnitude. In AI, vectors represent data points, features, or parameters.

```
v = [3, 4]        -- a 2D vector
w = [1, 0, -2]    -- a 3D vector
```

A 2D vector `[3, 4]` points to coordinates (3, 4) on a plane. Its length (magnitude) is 5 (the 3-4-5 triangle).

### Matrices: grids of numbers

A matrix is a 2D grid. Rows and columns. An m x n matrix has m rows and n columns.

```
A = | 1  2  3 |     -- 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
    | 4  5  6 |
```

In neural networks, weight matrices transform input vectors into output vectors. A layer with 784 inputs and 128 outputs uses a 128x784 weight matrix.

### Why shapes matter

Matrix multiplication has a strict rule: `(m x n) @ (n x p) = (m x p)`. The inner dimensions must match.

```
(128 x 784) @ (784 x 1) = (128 x 1)
  weights       input       output

Inner dimensions: 784 = 784  -- valid
```

If you get a shape mismatch error in PyTorch, this is why.

### The operations map

| Operation | What it does | Neural network use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Addition | Element-wise combine | Adding bias to output |
| Scalar multiply | Scale every element | Learning rate * gradients |
| Matrix multiply | Transform vectors | Layer forward pass |
| Transpose | Flip rows and columns | Backpropagation |
| Determinant | Single number summary | Checking invertibility |
| Inverse | Undo a transformation | Solving linear systems |
| Identity | Do-nothing matrix | Initialization, residual connections |

### Element-wise vs matrix multiplication

This distinction trips up beginners constantly.

Element-wise: multiply matching positions. Both matrices must be the same shape.

```
| 1  2 |   | 5  6 |   | 5  12 |
| 3  4 | * | 7  8 | = | 21 32 |
```

Matrix multiplication: dot products of rows and columns. Inner dimensions must match.

```
| 1  2 |   | 5  6 |   | 1*5+2*7  1*6+2*8 |   | 19  22 |
| 3  4 | @ | 7  8 | = | 3*5+4*7  3*6+4*8 | = | 43  50 |
```

Different operations, different results, different rules.

### Broadcasting

When you add a bias vector to a matrix of outputs, the shapes do not match. Broadcasting stretches the smaller array to fit.

```
| 1  2  3 |   +   [10, 20, 30]
| 4  5  6 |

Broadcasting stretches the vector across rows:

| 1  2  3 |   | 10  20  30 |   | 11  22  33 |
| 4  5  6 | + | 10  20  30 | = | 14  25  36 |
```

Every modern framework does this automatically. Understanding it prevents confusion when shapes seem wrong but the code runs.


## Use It

NumPy does everything above in fewer lines and orders of magnitude faster.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print("A + B =\n", A + B)
print("A * B (element-wise) =\n", A * B)
print("A @ B (matrix multiply) =\n", A @ B)
print("A^T =\n", A.T)
print("det(A) =", np.linalg.det(A))
print("A^-1 =\n", np.linalg.inv(A))
print("I =\n", np.eye(2))

inputs = np.random.randn(3, 1)
weights = np.random.randn(2, 3)
bias = np.array([[0.1], [0.1]])
output = np.maximum(0, weights @ inputs + bias)

print(f"\nNeural network layer: {weights.shape} @ {inputs.shape} = {output.shape}")
print(f"Output:\n{output}")
```

The `@` operator in Python calls `__matmul__`. NumPy implements it with optimized BLAS routines written in C and Fortran. Same math, 100x faster.

Broadcasting in NumPy:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
bias = np.array([10, 20, 30])
print(matrix + bias)
```

NumPy automatically broadcasts the 1D bias across both rows. This is how bias addition works in every neural network framework.

## Ship It

This lesson produces a prompt for teaching matrix operations through geometric intuition. See `outputs/prompt-matrix-operations.md`.

The Matrix class built here is the foundation for the mini neural network framework we build in Phase 3, Lesson 10.


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Vector | "An arrow" | An ordered list of numbers. In AI: a point in high-dimensional space. |
| Matrix | "A table of numbers" | A linear transformation. It maps vectors from one space to another. |
| Matrix multiply | "Just multiply the numbers" | Dot products between every row of the first matrix and every column of the second. Order matters. |
| Transpose | "Flip it" | Swap rows and columns. Turns an m x n matrix into n x m. Critical in backpropagation. |
| Determinant | "Some number from the matrix" | Measures how much the matrix scales area (2D) or volume (3D). Zero means the transformation crushes a dimension. |
| Inverse | "Undo the matrix" | The matrix that reverses the transformation. Only exists when the determinant is not zero. |
| Identity matrix | "The boring matrix" | The matrix equivalent of multiplying by 1. Used in residual connections (ResNets). |
| Broadcasting | "Magic shape fixing" | Stretching a smaller array to match a larger one by repeating along missing dimensions. |
| Element-wise | "Regular multiplication" | Multiply matching positions. Both arrays must have the same shape (or be broadcastable). |
