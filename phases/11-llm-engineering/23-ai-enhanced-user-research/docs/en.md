# AI-Enhanced User Research

> AI can summarize interviews in seconds. The product skill is protecting the signal from bias, privacy mistakes, and premature certainty.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 11 Lesson 01 (Prompt Engineering), Phase 11 Lesson 10 (Evaluation & Testing)
**Time:** ~45 minutes
**Capability:** Product and Process - AI-Enhanced User Research

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the operational signals that make this capability relevant in day-to-day LHIND work
- Build a lightweight Python artifact that turns an ambiguous AI idea into a structured plan
- Map risk, value, uncertainty, and controls into a practical course exercise
- Use the generated worksheet as a reusable starting point for team enablement
- Explain when the topic belongs in awareness training, guided pilot work, or a launch gate

## The Problem

A product team uploads interview notes to an assistant and asks for personas. The assistant produces confident segments and polished quotes. But some notes include personal data, the sample is biased toward power users, and the generated personas flatten important disagreement.

This lesson treats the course as a working session, not as a slide deck. Participants should leave with something they can use in the next project conversation: a checklist, matrix, prompt pack, memo, or scoring worksheet.

## The Concept

AI-enhanced research should accelerate synthesis, not replace research judgment. Use AI to cluster observations, extract themes, draft hypotheses, and find contradictions. Keep the team responsible for anonymization, sampling limits, evidence strength, and deciding what deserves another interview.

The recurring pattern is simple: identify the workflow, surface the signals, choose the right level of control, and produce an artifact that makes the next decision easier.

### Signals to Look For

- personal data
- single-source claim
- contradiction
- high emotion

### Controls to Teach

- anonymization
- evidence tags
- sample warning
- follow-up question

### Target Roles

- Products & Value Streams
- Business & Strategy Consulting


## Use It

Use the helper after interviews, support-ticket reviews, or usability tests. It helps product teams move faster while keeping claims traceable to evidence.

The expected output is not a final answer from AI. It is a better human conversation. The artifact makes the assumptions visible enough that a team can challenge them, tune the controls, and agree on the next step.

### Workshop Flow

1. Start with a real workflow from the participant's team.
2. Capture the signals in plain language.
3. Score impact and uncertainty together.
4. Review the recommended controls.
5. Decide whether the next step is awareness, practice, pilot, or launch gate.

## Reusable Artifact

Research synthesis canvas with evidence strength and follow-up questions.

The output template in `outputs/canvas-ai-research-synthesis.md` can be copied into a project kickoff, enablement workshop, or team retro. Keep the artifact short enough that teams actually use it.

## Key Takeaways

- The course is about operational judgment, not generic AI enthusiasm.
- A reusable artifact beats a one-time presentation because it changes the next project conversation.
- The right control level depends on workflow risk, uncertainty, business impact, and role accountability.
- AI can accelerate analysis, but the team still owns the decision, review, and rollout.

## Build It

Reconstruct **AI-Enhanced User Research** by following `Scenario` on x=0.5 with the demo defaults. Run `python3 main.py` and verify that the update or loss change agrees with the gradient sign; a zero gradient produces no accidental jump.

## Ship It

Hand off `outputs/canvas-ai-research-synthesis.md` with the command `python3 main.py`, the accepted input shape (x=0.5 with the demo defaults), the expected observable result, and a failure note for malformed inputs.

## Exercises

Treat this as a lab exercise. Preserve the setup and result, then explain which observation is doing the evidentiary work.

1. **Trace the happy path.** Run [main.py](../code/main.py) with `python3 main.py` from the lesson's `code/` directory. Record the smallest input that demonstrates “Identify the operational signals that make this capability relevant in day-to-day LHIND work”. Point to `normalize()`, `signal_matches()`, `score_scenario()` and name the returned field or printed value that serves as evidence.
2. **Perturb the input.** Change exactly one input, threshold, or option that affects “Build a lightweight Python artifact that turns an ambiguous AI idea into a structured plan”. Predict the direction of the change before running it, then compare the two outputs and explain why the other fields should stay stable.
3. **Test a failure case.** Construct a case that stresses “Map risk, value, uncertainty, and controls into a practical course exercise”: choose an empty collection, missing field, maximum-sized value, malformed record, or another boundary that fits this lesson. Write the expected behavior first and distinguish an intentional guard from an accidental crash.
4. **Transfer the result.** Open outputs/canvas-ai-research-synthesis.md and adapt one example to a real workflow. State the owner, evidence, and next decision required for “Use the generated worksheet as a reusable starting point for team enablement”; mark any assumption that the demo does not establish.

## Reference Solution

A complete handoff records python3 main.py, the observed output, and the reasoning behind it. Check:

- evidence for “Identify the operational signals that make this capability relevant in day-to-day LHIND work” with the relevant input and returned field;
- a one-variable comparison that makes “Build a lightweight Python artifact that turns an ambiguous AI idea into a structured plan” visible;
- a predicted and observed boundary result for “Map risk, value, uncertainty, and controls into a practical course exercise”, including why the behavior is safe; and
- one concrete update to outputs/canvas-ai-research-synthesis.md that applies “Use the generated worksheet as a reusable starting point for team enablement” without hiding uncertainty.

Use normalize(), signal_matches(), score_scenario() to explain the result, not only the prose output. If the experiment disagrees with the prediction, keep the failed prediction in the receipt and revise the explanation rather than changing the input until it passes.
