# Prompt Caching and Context Caching

> Your system prompt is 4,000 tokens. Your RAG context is 20,000 tokens. You send both with every request. You also pay for both — every time. Prompt caching lets the provider keep that prefix warm on their side and bill you 10% of the normal rate on reuse. Used correctly, it cuts inference cost by 50–90% and first-token latency by 40–85%.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 11 · 01 (Prompt Engineering), Phase 11 · 05 (Context Engineering), Phase 11 · 11 (Caching and Cost)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the production problem addressed by Prompt Caching and Context Caching
- Apply the lesson's decision or implementation workflow to a concrete case
- Measure quality, cost, latency, and risk with explicit acceptance criteria
- Identify failure modes and define a safe rollback or review path

## The Problem

A coding agent sends the same 15,000-token system prompt to Claude on every turn of a conversation. Twenty turns at $3/M input tokens is $0.90 in input cost alone — before any of the user's actual messages. Multiply by 10,000 daily conversations and the bill hits $9,000/day for text that never changes.

You cannot shrink the prompt without hurting quality. You cannot avoid sending it — the model needs it on every turn. The only move is to stop paying full price for a prefix the provider has already seen.

That move is prompt caching. Anthropic shipped it in August 2024 (with a 1-hour extended-TTL variant in 2025), OpenAI automated it later that year, Google shipped explicit context caching alongside Gemini 1.5, and all three now offer it as a first-class feature on their frontier models.

## The Concept

![Prompt caching: write once, read cheap](../assets/prompt-caching.svg)

**The mechanic.** When a request's prefix matches one from a recent request, the provider serves the KV-cache from the previous run instead of re-encoding the tokens. You pay a small write premium the first time and a large read discount every time after.

**Three provider flavors in 2026.**

| Provider | API style | Hit discount | Write premium | Default TTL | Min cacheable |
|---------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Anthropic | Explicit `cache_control` markers on content blocks | 90% off input | 25% surcharge | 5 min (extendable to 1 hour) | 1,024 tokens (Sonnet/Opus), 2,048 (Haiku) |
| OpenAI | Automatic prefix detection | 50% off input | none | Up to 1 hour (best-effort) | 1,024 tokens |
| Google (Gemini) | Explicit `CachedContent` API | Storage-billed; read at ~25% of normal | Storage fee per token·hour | User-set (default 1 hour) | 4,096 tokens (Flash), 32,768 (Pro) |

**The invariant.** All three cache prefixes only. If any token differs between requests, everything after the first differing token is a miss. Put the *stable* parts at the top, the *variable* parts at the bottom.

### The cache-friendly layout

```
[system prompt]          <-- cache this
[tool definitions]       <-- cache this
[few-shot examples]      <-- cache this
[retrieved documents]    <-- cache if reused, else don't
[conversation history]   <-- cache up to last turn
[current user message]   <-- never cache (different every time)
```

Violate the order — put the user message above the system prompt, interleave dynamic retrievals between few-shots — and the cache never hits.

### The break-even calculation

Anthropic's 25% write premium means a cached block has to be read at least twice to net-save money. 1 write + 1 read averages 0.675x cost per request (saves 32%); 1 write + 10 reads averages 0.205x (saves 80%). Rule of thumb: cache anything you expect to reuse at least 3 times within the TTL.

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Explain the production problem addressed by Prompt Caching and Context Caching.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Apply the lesson's decision or implementation workflow to a concrete case.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Measure quality, cost, latency, and risk with explicit acceptance criteria.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.py](../code/main.py) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Explain the production problem addressed by Prompt Caching and Context Caching,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Measure quality, cost, latency, and risk with explicit acceptance criteria,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.
