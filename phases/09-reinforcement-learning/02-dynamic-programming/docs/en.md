# Dynamic Programming — Policy Iteration & Value Iteration

> Dynamic programming is RL with cheating. You already know the transition and reward functions; you just iterate the Bellman equation until `V` or `π` stops moving. It is the benchmark every sampling-based method tries to approach.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 9 · 01 (MDPs)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Formulate Dynamic Programming — Policy Iteration & Value Iteration in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives
- Implement the central update rule from first principles
- Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment
- Evaluate convergence, stability, and exploration trade-offs

## The Problem

You have an MDP with a known model: you can query `P(s' | s, a)` and `R(s, a, s')` for any state-action pair. An inventory manager knows the demand distribution. A board game has deterministic transitions. A gridworld is four lines of Python. You have a *model*.

Model-free RL (Q-learning, PPO, REINFORCE) was invented for the case where you don't have a model — you can only sample from the environment. But when you do have one, there are faster, better methods: dynamic programming. Bellman designed them in 1957. They still define correctness: when people say "optimal policy for this MDP," they mean the policy DP would return.

You need them in 2026 for three reasons. First, every tabular environment in RL research (GridWorld, FrozenLake, CliffWalking) is solved with DP to produce the gold-standard policy. Second, exact values let you *debug* sampling methods: if Q-learning's estimate for `V*(s_0)` disagrees with the DP answer by 30%, your Q-learning has a bug. Third, modern offline RL and planning methods (MCTS, AlphaZero's search, model-based RL in Phase 9 · 10) all iterate a Bellman backup over a learned or given model.

## The Concept

![Policy iteration and value iteration, side by side](../assets/dp.svg)

**Two algorithms, both fixed-point iteration on Bellman.**

**Policy iteration.** Alternates two steps until the policy stops changing.

1. *Evaluation:* given policy `π`, compute `V^π` by repeatedly applying `V(s) ← Σ_a π(a|s) Σ_{s',r} P(s',r|s,a) [r + γ V(s')]` until it converges.
2. *Improvement:* given `V^π`, make `π` greedy w.r.t. `V^π`: `π(s) ← argmax_a Σ_{s',r} P(s',r|s,a) [r + γ V(s')]`.

Convergence is guaranteed because (a) each improvement step either keeps `π` the same or strictly increases `V^π` for some state, (b) the space of deterministic policies is finite. Usually converges in ~5–20 outer iterations even for large state spaces.

**Value iteration.** Collapses evaluation and improvement into one sweep. Apply the Bellman *optimality* equation:

`V(s) ← max_a Σ_{s',r} P(s',r|s,a) [r + γ V(s')]`

Repeat until `max_s |V_{new}(s) - V(s)| < ε`. Extract the policy at the end by taking the greedy action. Strictly faster per iteration — no inner evaluation loop — but typically needs more iterations to converge.

**Generalized policy iteration (GPI).** The unifying framing. Value function and policy are locked in a two-way improvement loop; any method that drives both toward mutual consistency (async value iteration, modified policy iteration, Q-learning, actor-critic, PPO) is an instance of GPI.

**Why `γ < 1` matters.** The Bellman operator is a `γ`-contraction in the sup-norm: `||T V - T V'||_∞ ≤ γ ||V - V'||_∞`. Contraction implies unique fixed point and geometric convergence. Drop `γ < 1` and you lose the guarantee — you need a finite horizon or an absorbing terminal state.

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Formulate Dynamic Programming — Policy Iteration & Value Iteration in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Implement the central update rule from first principles.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.py](../code/main.py) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Formulate Dynamic Programming — Policy Iteration & Value Iteration in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.
