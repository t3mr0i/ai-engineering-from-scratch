# Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch

> Stop estimating value. Parameterize the policy directly, compute the gradient of expected return, step uphill. Williams (1992) wrote it in one theorem. It is why PPO, GRPO, and every LLM RL loop exist.

## Learning Objectives

- Formulate Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives
- Implement the central update rule from first principles
- Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment
- Evaluate convergence, stability, and exploration trade-offs

## The Problem

Q-learning and DQN parameterize the *value* function. You pick actions by `argmax Q`. That is fine for discrete actions and discrete states. It breaks when actions are continuous (which `argmax` over a 10-dimensional torque?) or when you want a stochastic policy (`argmax` is deterministic by construction).

Policy gradients parameterize the *policy* instead. `π_θ(a | s)` is a neural net that outputs a distribution over actions. Sample from it to act. Compute the gradient of expected return with respect to `θ`. Step uphill. No `argmax`. No Bellman recursion. Just gradient ascent on `J(θ) = E_{π_θ}[G]`.

The REINFORCE theorem (Williams 1992) tells you this gradient is computable: `∇J(θ) = E_π[ G · ∇_θ log π_θ(a | s) ]`. Run an episode. Compute the return. Multiply by `∇ log π_θ(a | s)` at every step. Average. Gradient-ascent. Done.

Every LLM-RL algorithm in 2026 — PPO, DPO, GRPO — is a refinement of REINFORCE. Understanding it in your fingers is the prerequisite for the rest of this phase, and for Phase 10 · 07 (RLHF implementation) and Phase 10 · 08 (DPO).

## The Concept

![Policy gradient: softmax policy, log-π gradient, return-weighted update](../assets/policy-gradient.svg)

**The policy gradient theorem.** For any policy `π_θ` parameterized by `θ`:

`∇J(θ) = E_{τ ~ π_θ}[ Σ_{t=0}^{T} G_t · ∇_θ log π_θ(a_t | s_t) ]`

where `G_t = Σ_{k=t}^{T} γ^{k-t} r_{k+1}` is the discounted return from step `t`. The expectation is over full trajectories `τ` sampled from `π_θ`.

**The proof is short.** Differentiate `J(θ) = Σ_τ P(τ; θ) G(τ)` under the expectation. Use `∇P(τ; θ) = P(τ; θ) ∇ log P(τ; θ)` (the log-derivative trick). Factor `log P(τ; θ) = Σ log π_θ(a_t | s_t) + environment terms that do not depend on θ`. The environment terms vanish. Two lines of algebra give you the theorem.

**Variance reduction tricks.** Vanilla REINFORCE has murderous variance — returns are noisy, `∇ log π` is noisy, their product is very noisy. Two standard fixes:

1. **Baseline subtraction.** Replace `G_t` with `G_t - b(s_t)` for any baseline `b(s_t)` that does not depend on `a_t`. Unbiased because `E[b(s_t) · ∇ log π(a_t | s_t)] = 0`. Typical choice: `b(s_t) = V̂(s_t)` learned by a critic → actor-critic (Lesson 07).
2. **Reward-to-go.** Replace `Σ_t G_t · ∇ log π_θ(a_t | s_t)` with `Σ_t G_t^{from t} · ∇ log π_θ(a_t | s_t)`. Only future returns matter for a given action — past rewards contribute zero-mean noise.

Combined, you get:

`∇J ≈ (1/N) Σ_{i=1}^{N} Σ_{t=0}^{T_i} [ G_t^{(i)} - V̂(s_t^{(i)}) ] · ∇_θ log π_θ(a_t^{(i)} | s_t^{(i)})`

which is REINFORCE with a baseline — the direct ancestor of A2C (Lesson 07) and PPO (Lesson 08).

**Softmax policy parameterization.** For discrete actions, the standard choice:

`π_θ(a | s) = exp(f_θ(s, a)) / Σ_{a'} exp(f_θ(s, a'))`

where `f_θ` is any neural net that outputs a score per action. The gradient has a clean form:

`∇_θ log π_θ(a | s) = ∇_θ f_θ(s, a) - Σ_{a'} π_θ(a' | s) ∇_θ f_θ(s, a')`

i.e., score of the taken action minus its expected value under the policy.

**Gaussian policy for continuous actions.** `π_θ(a | s) = N(μ_θ(s), σ_θ(s))`. `∇ log N(a; μ, σ)` has a closed form. That is all Phase 9 · 07's SAC needs.




## Build It

Reconstruct **Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch** by following `reset` on x=0.5 with the demo defaults. Run `python3 main.py` and verify that the update or loss change agrees with the gradient sign; a zero gradient produces no accidental jump.

## Use It

Call `reset` from a small caller with x=0.5 with the demo defaults. Compare its result with the demo output, and record the input contract and the one field a downstream user should rely on.

## Ship It

Hand off `outputs/skill-policy-gradient-trainer.md` with the command `python3 main.py`, the accepted input shape (x=0.5 with the demo defaults), the expected observable result, and a failure note for malformed inputs.

## Exercises

Use `reset` as the trace: start from x=0.5 with the demo defaults, keep the raw output, and tie each observation to a named objective.

1. **Reproduce the reference path.** From `code/`, run `python3 main.py` using x=0.5 with the demo defaults. Follow `reset`, `step`, `features`. Expect the update or loss change agrees with the gradient sign; a zero gradient produces no accidental jump; capture the first printed shape, metric, status, or summary field and state which part supports **Formulate Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives**.
2. **Vary one named input.** Repeat the command after changing only the learning rate: use the same run with learning rate 0.1 instead of 0.01. Predict the direction of the change, then compare the two output values. Explain why **Implement the central update rule from first principles** says the other inputs should stay fixed.
3. **Probe the empty case.** Feed the implementation a zero gradient or an already-minimized point. Before running it, write down whether the relevant function should return an empty value, a zero-sized result, or a validation error. Check the observed status against **Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment** and record the exception text if the code rejects the case.
4. **Package a usable handoff.** Open `outputs/skill-policy-gradient-trainer.md` and add a worked example using x=0.5 with the demo defaults. Include the input contract, one expected output field, and a named acceptance check for **Evaluate convergence, stability, and exploration trade-offs**; note what the demo cannot establish.

## Reference Solution

A checkable result for **Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch** should contain:

- the `python3 main.py` output for x=0.5 with the demo defaults, with `reset`, `step`, `features` traced to the value or shape that supports **Formulate Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives**;
- a before/after comparison for the learning rate, where the same run with learning rate 0.1 instead of 0.01 changes the observation in the direction predicted by **Implement the central update rule from first principles**;
- a recorded result for a zero gradient or an already-minimized point that matches the implementation’s validation or empty-result contract and explains the evidence for **Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment**; and
- an updated `outputs/skill-policy-gradient-trainer.md` example with a concrete input, expected output field, and acceptance check tied to **Evaluate convergence, stability, and exploration trade-offs**.

Run the lesson tests after the demo. If the boundary behaves differently from the prediction, keep the actual exception or output and explain the implementation path that produced it.
