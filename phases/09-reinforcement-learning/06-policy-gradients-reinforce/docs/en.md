# Policy Gradient — REINFORCE from Scratch

> Stop estimating value. Parameterize the policy directly, compute the gradient of expected return, step uphill. Williams (1992) wrote it in one theorem. It is why PPO, GRPO, and every LLM RL loop exist.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 3 · 03 (Backpropagation), Phase 9 · 03 (Monte Carlo), Phase 9 · 04 (TD Learning)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## The Problem

Q-learning and DQN parameterize the *value* function. You pick actions by `argmax Q`. That is fine for discrete actions and discrete states. It breaks when actions are continuous (which `argmax` over a 10-dimensional torque?) or when you want a stochastic policy (`argmax` is deterministic by construction).

Policy gradients parameterize the *policy* instead. `π_θ(a | s)` is a neural net that outputs a distribution over actions. Sample from it to act. Compute the gradient of expected return with respect to `θ`. Step uphill. No `argmax`. No Bellman recursion. Just gradient ascent on `J(θ) = E_{π_θ}[G]`.

The REINFORCE theorem (Williams 1992) tells you this gradient is computable: `∇J(θ) = E_π[ G · ∇_θ log π_θ(a | s) ]`. Run an episode. Compute the return. Multiply by `∇ log π_θ(a | s)` at every step. Average. Gradient-ascent. Done.

Every LLM-RL algorithm in 2026 — PPO, DPO, GRPO — is a refinement of REINFORCE. Understanding it in your fingers is the prerequisite for the rest of this phase, and for Phase 10 · 07 (RLHF implementation) and Phase 10 · 08 (DPO).

## The Concept

![Policy gradient: softmax policy, log-π gradient, return-weighted update](../assets/policy-gradient.svg)

**The policy gradient theorem.** For any policy `π_θ` parameterized by `θ`:

`∇J(θ) = E_{τ ~ π_θ}[ Σ_{t=0}^{T} G_t · ∇_θ log π_θ(a_t | s_t) ]`

where `G_t = Σ_{k=t}^{T} γ^{k-t} r_{k+1}` is the discounted return from step `t`. The expectation is over full trajectories `τ` sampled from `π_θ`.

**The proof is short.** Differentiate `J(θ) = Σ_τ P(τ; θ) G(τ)` under the expectation. Use `∇P(τ; θ) = P(τ; θ) ∇ log P(τ; θ)` (the log-derivative trick). Factor `log P(τ; θ) = Σ log π_θ(a_t | s_t) + environment terms that do not depend on θ`. The environment terms vanish. Two lines of algebra give you the theorem.

**Variance reduction tricks.** Vanilla REINFORCE has murderous variance — returns are noisy, `∇ log π` is noisy, their product is very noisy. Two standard fixes:

1. **Baseline subtraction.** Replace `G_t` with `G_t - b(s_t)` for any baseline `b(s_t)` that does not depend on `a_t`. Unbiased because `E[b(s_t) · ∇ log π(a_t | s_t)] = 0`. Typical choice: `b(s_t) = V̂(s_t)` learned by a critic → actor-critic (Lesson 07).
2. **Reward-to-go.** Replace `Σ_t G_t · ∇ log π_θ(a_t | s_t)` with `Σ_t G_t^{from t} · ∇ log π_θ(a_t | s_t)`. Only future returns matter for a given action — past rewards contribute zero-mean noise.

Combined, you get:

`∇J ≈ (1/N) Σ_{i=1}^{N} Σ_{t=0}^{T_i} [ G_t^{(i)} - V̂(s_t^{(i)}) ] · ∇_θ log π_θ(a_t^{(i)} | s_t^{(i)})`

which is REINFORCE with a baseline — the direct ancestor of A2C (Lesson 07) and PPO (Lesson 08).

**Softmax policy parameterization.** For discrete actions, the standard choice:

`π_θ(a | s) = exp(f_θ(s, a)) / Σ_{a'} exp(f_θ(s, a'))`

where `f_θ` is any neural net that outputs a score per action. The gradient has a clean form:

`∇_θ log π_θ(a | s) = ∇_θ f_θ(s, a) - Σ_{a'} π_θ(a' | s) ∇_θ f_θ(s, a')`

i.e., score of the taken action minus its expected value under the policy.

**Gaussian policy for continuous actions.** `π_θ(a | s) = N(μ_θ(s), σ_θ(s))`. `∇ log N(a; μ, σ)` has a closed form. That is all Phase 9 · 07's SAC needs.


## Use It

In 2026, REINFORCE is rarely run directly but its gradient formula is everywhere:

| Use case | Derived method |
|----------|---------------|
| Continuous control | PPO / SAC with Gaussian policy |
| LLM RLHF | PPO with KL penalty, running on token-level policy |
| LLM reasoning (DeepSeek) | GRPO — REINFORCE with group-relative baseline, no critic |
| Multi-agent | Centralized-critic REINFORCE (MADDPG, COMA) |
| Discrete action robotics | A2C, A3C, PPO |
| Preference-only settings | DPO — REINFORCE rewritten as a preference-likelihood loss, no sampling |

When you read `loss = -advantage * log_prob` in a 2026 training script, that is REINFORCE with a baseline. Entire papers (DPO, GRPO, RLOO) are variance-reduction tricks on top of this one line.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/skill-policy-gradient-trainer.md`:

Given an environment (discrete / continuous actions, horizon, reward stats), output:

1. Policy head. Softmax (discrete) or Gaussian (continuous) with parameter counts.
2. Baseline. None (vanilla), running mean, learned `V̂(s)`, or A2C critic.
3. Variance controls. Reward-to-go on by default, return normalization, gradient clip value.
4. Entropy bonus. Coefficient β and decay schedule.
5. Batch size. Episodes per update; on-policy data freshness contract.

Refuse REINFORCE-no-baseline on horizons > 500 steps. Refuse continuous-action control with a softmax head. Flag any run with `β = 0` and observed policy entropy < 0.1 as entropy-collapsed.

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Policy gradient | "Train the policy directly" | `∇J(θ) = E[G · ∇ log π_θ(a\|s)]`; derived from the log-derivative trick. |
| REINFORCE | "The original PG algorithm" | Williams (1992); Monte Carlo returns multiplied by log-policy gradient. |
| Log-derivative trick | "Score function estimator" | `∇P(τ;θ) = P(τ;θ) · ∇ log P(τ;θ)`; makes gradients of expectations tractable. |
| Baseline | "Variance reduction" | Any `b(s)` subtracted from `G`; unbiased because `E[b · ∇ log π] = 0`. |
| Reward-to-go | "Only future returns count" | `G_t^{from t}` instead of the full `G_0`; correct and lower-variance. |
| Entropy bonus | "Encourage exploration" | `+β · H(π(·\|s))` term keeps the policy from collapsing. |
| On-policy | "Train on what you just saw" | Gradient expectation is w.r.t. the current policy — cannot reuse old data directly. |
| Advantage | "How much better than average" | `A(s, a) = G(s, a) - V(s)`; the signed quantity REINFORCE-with-baseline multiplies. |
