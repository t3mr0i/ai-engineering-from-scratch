# Actor-Critic — A2C and A3C

> REINFORCE is noisy. Add a critic that learns `V̂(s)`, subtract it from the return, and you get an advantage that has the same expectation but far lower variance. That is actor-critic. A2C runs it synchronously; A3C runs it across threads. Both are the mental model for every modern deep-RL method.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 9 · 04 (TD Learning), Phase 9 · 06 (REINFORCE)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Formulate Actor-Critic — A2C and A3C in terms of states, actions, rewards, and objectives
- Implement the central update rule from first principles
- Trace learning signals through a self-terminating experiment
- Evaluate convergence, stability, and exploration trade-offs

## The Problem

Vanilla REINFORCE works, but its variance is terrible. Monte Carlo returns `G_t` can swing over a factor of 10 between episodes. Multiplying that noise by `∇ log π` and averaging produces a gradient estimator that takes thousands of episodes to move the policy the same distance you could move it with far fewer DQN updates.

The variance comes from using raw returns. If you subtract a baseline `b(s_t)` — any function of state, including a learned value — the expectation is unchanged and the variance drops. The best tractable baseline is `V̂(s_t)`. Now the quantity multiplying `∇ log π` is the *advantage*:

`A(s, a) = G - V̂(s)`

An action is good if it produced above-average return; bad if below. REINFORCE with a learned critic is *actor-critic*. The critic gives the actor a low-variance teacher. This is every deep-policy method after 2015 (A2C, A3C, PPO, SAC, IMPALA).

## The Concept

![Actor-critic: policy net plus value net, TD residual as advantage](../assets/actor-critic.svg)

**Two networks, one shared loss:**

- **Actor** `π_θ(a | s)`: the policy. Sampled to act. Trained with policy gradient.
- **Critic** `V_φ(s)`: estimates expected return from state. Trained to minimize `(V_φ(s) - target)²`.

**The advantage.** Two standard forms:

- *MC advantage:* `A_t = G_t - V_φ(s_t)`. Unbiased, higher variance.
- *TD advantage:* `A_t = r_{t+1} + γ V_φ(s_{t+1}) - V_φ(s_t)`. Biased (uses `V_φ`), far lower variance. Also called the *TD residual* `δ_t`.

**n-step advantage.** Interpolate between the two:

`A_t^{(n)} = r_{t+1} + γ r_{t+2} + … + γ^{n-1} r_{t+n} + γ^n V_φ(s_{t+n}) - V_φ(s_t)`

`n = 1` is pure TD. `n = ∞` is MC. Most implementations use `n = 5` for Atari, `n = 2048` for PPO on MuJoCo.

**Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).** Schulman et al. (2016) proposed an exponentially weighted average over all n-step advantages:

`A_t^{GAE} = Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (γλ)^l δ_{t+l}`

with `λ ∈ [0, 1]`. `λ = 0` is TD (low variance, high bias). `λ = 1` is MC (high variance, unbiased). `λ = 0.95` is the 2026 default — tune until the bias/variance dial is where you want it.

**A2C: synchronous advantage actor-critic.** Collect `T` steps across `N` parallel environments. Compute advantages for each step. Update actor and critic on the combined batch. Repeat. The simpler, more-scalable sibling of A3C.

**A3C: asynchronous advantage actor-critic.** Mnih et al. (2016). Spawn `N` worker threads, each running an env. Each worker computes gradients locally on its own rollout, then asynchronously applies them to a shared parameter server. No replay buffer needed — workers decorrelate by running different trajectories. A3C proved you could train on CPUs at scale. In 2026, GPU-based A2C (batched parallel envs) dominates because GPUs want large batches.

**The combined loss.**

`L(θ, φ) = -E[ A_t · log π_θ(a_t | s_t) ]  +  c_v · E[(V_φ(s_t) - G_t)²]  -  c_e · E[H(π_θ(·|s_t))]`

Three terms: policy-gradient loss, value regression, entropy bonus. `c_v ~ 0.5`, `c_e ~ 0.01` are canonical starting points.
