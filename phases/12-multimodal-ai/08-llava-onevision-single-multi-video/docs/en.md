# LLaVA-OneVision: Single-Image, Multi-Image, Video in One Model

> Before LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., August 2024) the open-VLM world had separate lineages: LLaVA-1.5 for single images, multi-image models like Mantis and VILA, video models like Video-LLaVA and Video-LLaMA. Each won its benchmark and failed at the others. LLaVA-OneVision argued a single curriculum could train one model to dominate all three scenarios, and that the emergent task-transfer effects (single-image skills exported to video, multi-image reasoning exported to single-image) beat the sum of specialists. The recipe is deceptively simple: a visual-token budget that stays constant across scenarios, plus an explicit curriculum that moves from single-image to OneVision (multi-image) to video. This lesson reads the budget, the curriculum, and the emergent behaviors.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 12 · 05 (LLaVA), Phase 12 · 06 (any-resolution)
**Time:** ~180 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Design a visual-token budget that holds constant across single-image, multi-image, and video inputs.
- Order a training curriculum that transfers skills from single-image to video without catastrophic forgetting.
- Explain why a single model beats specialists at the same parameter count when curriculum is done right.
- Name the three emergent capabilities reported by LLaVA-OneVision: multi-camera reasoning, set-of-mark prompting, iPhone-screenshot agent.

## The Problem

Image, multi-image, and video each stress a model differently.

Single-image wants high-resolution tokens (AnyRes, ~2880 visual tokens) to catch OCR and fine detail. Budget per sample: one image, 2880 tokens.

Multi-image wants several images at moderate resolution (~576 tokens each) so reasoning across images fits in context. Budget per sample: 4-8 images, 576 each, 2300-4600 tokens.

Video wants many frames at low resolution (~196 tokens per frame after pooling) to capture temporal dynamics. Budget per sample: 8-32 frames, 196 each, 1600-6200 tokens.

If you train separate models, you pick one budget. If you train one model, you need the budget to scale sensibly across scenarios without blowing context.

Pre-OneVision, the default answer was "train one scenario, ignore the others." Video-LLaVA retrofitted video onto an image model with extra training stages. LLaVA-NeXT added multi-image support with tiling. None handled all three cleanly.

## The Concept

### The OneVision token budget

LLaVA-OneVision picks a unified visual-token budget of approximately 3000-4000 tokens per sample, allocated differently per scenario:

- Single image: AnyRes-9 (3x3 tiles + thumbnail), each tile at 384 with 729 patches, aggressive bilinear pooling 2x2 → 182 per tile. Total: 9 * 182 + 182 = 1820 tokens. Or AnyRes-4 at 729-per-tile = 2916 + 729.
- Multi-image: each image at moderate resolution (384, no tiling), 729 tokens with no pooling. Budget 6 images → 4374 tokens.
- Video: 32 frames at 384 resolution with aggressive 3x3 bilinear pool → 81 tokens per frame. Total: 32 * 81 = 2592 tokens.

The allocation maintains roughly constant total tokens. The LLM never sees a batch that blows its context. The encoder produces different geometry per scenario, but the LLM consumes the same budget.

### The three-stage curriculum

LLaVA-OneVision trains in three stages:

1. Single-image SFT (stage SI). All data is single-image-plus-text. Train on high-resolution AnyRes input. This teaches perception, OCR, and fine-grained understanding. Uses LLaVA-NeXT data plus OneVision-specific single-image data.
2. OneVision SFT (stage OV). Mix single-image + multi-image + video (uniformly sampled frames). Train on the unified token budget. This teaches the model to handle heterogeneous batch shapes. No weight reset — continues from stage SI.
3. Task transfer (stage TT). Continue with a target task mix, typically heavier on multi-image or video depending on product. Optional fine-tune for deployment.

Critical: the curriculum order matters. Training video-first or multi-image-first produces worse image performance than single-image-first, even with the same data. The paper ablates this explicitly.

### Why curriculum works

Single-image training builds the perceptual base. Patch tokens carry fine-grained visual features; the LLM learns to integrate them with text. Multi-image and video introduce structural challenges (which image is which, what happened first) that are hard to learn without a strong perceptual base.

If you train all scenarios from scratch together, the model underfits perception (limited single-image data per batch) and overfits structure (lots of multi-image / video data). Result: a model that follows cross-image reasoning patterns but is visually shallow.

Curriculum ordering gives you perception strength from stage SI, then compositional/temporal reasoning from stage OV, without losing either.

### Emergent cross-scenario skills

The LLaVA-OneVision paper reports three emergent capabilities:

1. Multi-camera reasoning. Trained on multi-image + video separately; at inference, asked to reason about a multi-camera driving scene. The model correctly integrates the views despite never seeing that exact format in training.
2. Set-of-mark prompting. User annotates objects in an image with numbered marks; the model reasons about "what is mark 3 doing relative to mark 7." Trained on neither marks nor annotation; learned from the combination of spatial grounding + multi-image reference.
3. iPhone-screenshot agent. User provides a screenshot of an iPhone screen and asks to plan the next click. Trained on UI screenshots, video of user workflows, and multi-image before/after pairs. Generalizes to the agent use case.

These are not trained tasks; they emerge from the curriculum's compositional structure.

### Visual-token pooling

The token budget requires pooling. OneVision uses bilinear interpolation on the 2D patch grid: 24x24 = 576 patches becomes 12x12 = 144 (2x factor) or 8x8 = 64 (3x factor). Pooling is done in patch-grid space, not token space, to preserve locality.

The choice of pooling factor per scenario is itself a hyperparameter. Less pooling = more tokens = richer representation. More pooling = fewer tokens = more frames / images fit.

### LLaVA-OneVision-1.5

The 2025 follow-up (LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, arXiv 2509.23661) is "fully open" in training data, model weights, and code. Matches the proprietary gap on some benchmarks and democratizes the recipe. Same curriculum, more data, better base LLM. No architecture change.

### Contrast with Qwen2.5-VL

Qwen2.5-VL (Lesson 12.09) makes different choices. It uses M-RoPE and dynamic FPS instead of fixed pooling. Its budget scales with input — a 1-minute video uses more tokens than a 5-second video. LLaVA-OneVision fixes the budget and scales the pooling. Both work; they trade configurability for predictability.
