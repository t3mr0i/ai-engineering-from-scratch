# Topic Modeling — LDA and BERTopic

> LDA: documents are mixtures of topics, topics are distributions over words. BERTopic: documents cluster in embedding space, clusters are topics. Same goal, different decompositions.

**Type:** Learn
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 · 02 (BoW + TF-IDF), Phase 5 · 03 (Word2Vec)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the core mechanism in Topic Modeling — LDA and BERTopic and place it in an NLP pipeline
- Implement the central transformation behind Topic Modeling — LDA and BERTopic from first principles
- Inspect intermediate representations to connect the algorithm to its output
- Evaluate failure cases and choose appropriate metrics for Topic Modeling — LDA and BERTopic

## The Problem

You have 10,000 customer support tickets, 50,000 news articles, or 200,000 tweets. You need to know what the collection is about without reading it. You do not have labeled categories. You do not even know how many categories exist.

Topic modeling answers that without supervision. Give it a corpus, get back a small set of coherent topics and, for each document, a distribution over those topics.

Two algorithmic families dominate. LDA (2003) treats each document as a mixture of latent topics and each topic as a distribution over words. Inference is Bayesian. It still ships in production where you need mixed-membership topic assignments and explainable word-level probability distributions.

BERTopic (2020) encodes documents with BERT, reduces dimensionality with UMAP, clusters with HDBSCAN, and extracts topic words via class-based TF-IDF. It wins on short text, social media, and anything where semantic similarity matters more than word overlap. One document gets one topic, which is a limitation for long-form content.

This lesson builds intuition for both and names which one to pick for a given corpus.

## The Concept

![LDA mixture model vs BERTopic clustering](../assets/topic-modeling.svg)

**LDA generative story.** Each topic is a distribution over words. Each document is a mixture of topics. To generate a word in a document, sample a topic from the document's mixture, then sample a word from that topic's distribution. Inference reverses this: given observed words, infer the topic distribution per document and the word distribution per topic. Collapsed Gibbs sampling or variational Bayes does the math.

Key LDA output:

- `doc_topic`: matrix `(n_docs, n_topics)`, each row sums to 1 (document's topic mixture).
- `topic_word`: matrix `(n_topics, vocab_size)`, each row sums to 1 (topic's word distribution).

**BERTopic pipeline.**

1. Encode each document with a sentence transformer (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). 384-dim vectors.
2. Reduce dimensionality with UMAP to ~5 dimensions. BERT embeddings are too high-dim for clustering.
3. Cluster with HDBSCAN. Density-based, produces variable-size clusters and an "outlier" label.
4. For each cluster, compute class-based TF-IDF over the cluster's documents to extract top words.

Output is one topic per document (plus a -1 outlier label). Optionally, a soft membership via HDBSCAN's probability vector.
