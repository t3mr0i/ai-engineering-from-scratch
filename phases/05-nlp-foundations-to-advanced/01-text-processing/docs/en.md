# Text Processing — Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization

> Language is continuous. Models are discrete. Preprocessing is the bridge.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 · 14 (Naive Bayes)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## The Problem

A model cannot read "The cats were running." It reads integers.

Every NLP system opens with the same three questions. Where does a word start. What is the root of the word. How do we treat "run", "running", "ran" as the same thing when it helps, and as different things when it doesn't.

Get tokenization wrong and the model learns from garbage. If your tokenizer treats `don't` as one token but `do n't` as two, the training distribution splits. If your stemmer collapses `organization` and `organ` to the same stem, topic modeling dies. If your lemmatizer needs part-of-speech context but you don't pass it, verbs get treated as nouns.

This lesson builds the three preprocessing steps from scratch, then shows how NLTK and spaCy do the same work so you can see the tradeoffs.

## The Concept

Three operations. Each has a job and a failure mode.

**Tokenization** splits a string into tokens. "Token" is deliberately vague because the right granularity depends on the task. Word-level for classical NLP. Subword for transformers. Character for languages without whitespace.

**Stemming** chops suffixes with rules. Fast, aggressive, dumb. `running -> run`. `organization -> organ`. That second one is the failure mode.

**Lemmatization** reduces a word to its dictionary form using grammar knowledge. Slower, accurate, needs a lookup table or morphological analyzer. `ran -> run` (needs to know "ran" is past tense of "run"). `better -> good` (needs to know comparative forms).

Rule of thumb. Stem when speed matters and you can tolerate noise (search indexing, rough classification). Lemmatize when meaning matters (question answering, semantic search, anything the user will read).


## Use It

NLTK and spaCy ship the production versions. A few lines each.

### NLTK

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("punkt_tab")
nltk.download("wordnet")
nltk.download("averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng")

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk import pos_tag

text = "The cats were running."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
stems = [PorterStemmer().stem(t) for t in tokens]
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
tagged = pos_tag(tokens)


def nltk_pos_to_wordnet(tag):
    if tag.startswith("V"):
        return "v"
    if tag.startswith("J"):
        return "a"
    if tag.startswith("R"):
        return "r"
    return "n"


lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t, nltk_pos_to_wordnet(tag)) for t, tag in tagged]
```

`word_tokenize` handles contractions, Unicode, edge cases your regex misses. `PorterStemmer` runs all five phases. `WordNetLemmatizer` needs the POS tag translated from NLTK's Penn Treebank scheme to WordNet's abbreviation set. The translation wiring above is the bit most tutorials skip.

### spaCy

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("The cats were running.")

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_)
```

```
The      the     DET
cats     cat     NOUN
were     be      AUX
running  run     VERB
.        .       PUNCT
```

spaCy hides the whole pipeline behind `nlp(text)`. Tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization all run. Faster than NLTK at scale. More accurate out of the box. The tradeoff is that you cannot easily swap individual components.

### When to pick which

| Situation | Pick |
|-----------|------|
| Teaching, research, swapping components | NLTK |
| Production, multi-language, speed matters | spaCy |
| Transformer pipeline (you'll tokenize with the model's tokenizer anyway) | Use `tokenizers` / `transformers` and skip classical preprocessing |

### The two failure modes nobody warns you about

Most tutorials teach the algorithms and stop. Two things will bite a real preprocessing pipeline, and they are almost never covered.

**Reproducibility drift.** NLTK and spaCy change tokenization and lemmatizer behavior between versions. What produced `['do', "n't"]` in spaCy 2.x may produce `["don't"]` in 3.x. Your model was trained on one distribution. Inference now runs on a different one. Accuracy quietly degrades and nobody knows why. Pin library versions in `requirements.txt`. Write a preprocessing regression test that freezes expected tokenization of 20 sample sentences. Run it on every upgrade.

**Training / inference mismatch.** Train with aggressive preprocessing (lowercase, stopword removal, stemming), deploy on raw user input, watch performance crater. This is the single most common production NLP failure. If you preprocess during training, you must run the identical function during inference. Ship preprocessing as a function inside the model package, not as a notebook cell the serving team rewrites.

## Ship It

A reusable prompt that helps engineers pick a preprocessing strategy without reading three textbooks.

Save as `outputs/prompt-preprocessing-advisor.md`:

```markdown
---
name: preprocessing-advisor
description: Recommends a tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization setup for an NLP task.
phase: 5
lesson: 01
---

You advise on classical NLP preprocessing. Given a task description, you output:

1. Tokenization choice (regex, NLTK word_tokenize, spaCy, or transformer tokenizer). Explain why.
2. Whether to stem, lemmatize, both, or neither. Explain why.
3. Specific library calls. Name the functions. Quote the POS-tag translation if NLTK is involved.
4. One failure mode the user should test for.

Refuse to recommend stemming for user-visible text. Refuse to recommend lemmatization without POS tags. Flag non-English input as needing a different pipeline.
```


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Token | A word | Whatever unit the model consumes. Can be word, subword, character, or byte. |
| Stem | Root of a word | Result of rule-based suffix stripping. Not always a real word. |
| Lemma | Dictionary form | The form you'd look up. Requires grammatical context to compute correctly. |
| POS tag | Part of speech | Category like NOUN, VERB, ADJ. Needed to lemmatize accurately. |
| Morphology | Word shape rules | How a word changes form based on tense, number, case. Lemmatization depends on it. |
