# Sentiment Analysis

> The canonical NLP task. Most of what you need to know about classical text classification shows up here.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 · 02 (BoW + TF-IDF), Phase 2 · 14 (Naive Bayes)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## The Problem

"The food was not great." Positive or negative?

Sentiment sounds simple. A reviewer said they liked or did not like something. Label the sentence. The reason it became the canonical NLP task is that every easy-looking case hides a hard one. Negation flips meaning. Sarcasm inverts it. "Not bad at all" is positive despite two negative-coded words. Emojis carry more signal than surrounding text. Domain vocabulary matters (`tight` in music review versus `tight` in fashion review).

Sentiment is a working lab for classical NLP. If you understand why every naive baseline has a specific failure mode, you understand why every richer model was invented. This lesson builds a Naive Bayes baseline from scratch, adds logistic regression, and names the traps that make production sentiment a compliance-grade problem.

## The Concept

Classical sentiment is a two-step recipe.

1. **Represent.** Turn the text into a feature vector. BoW, TF-IDF, or n-grams.
2. **Classify.** Fit a linear model (Naive Bayes, logistic regression, SVM) on labeled examples.

Naive Bayes is the dumbest model that works. Assume every feature is independent given the label. Estimate `P(word | positive)` and `P(word | negative)` from counts. At inference, multiply the probabilities. The "naive" independence assumption is laughably wrong and yet the results are shockingly strong. The reason: with sparse text features and moderate data, the classifier cares about which side each word leans toward more than how much.

Logistic regression fixes the independence assumption. It learns a weight per feature, including negative weights. `not good` as a bigram feature gets a negative weight. Naive Bayes cannot do that for bigrams it has never labeled.


## Use It

scikit-learn does it in six lines, correctly.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipe = Pipeline([
    ("tfidf", TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), min_df=2, sublinear_tf=True, stop_words=None)),
    ("clf", LogisticRegression(C=1.0, max_iter=1000)),
])
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(pipe.score(X_test, y_test))
```

Three things to notice. `stop_words=None` keeps negations. `ngram_range=(1, 2)` adds bigrams so `not_good` becomes a feature. `sublinear_tf=True` dampens repeated words. These three flags are the difference between a 75%-accurate baseline and an 85%-accurate baseline on SST-2.

### When to reach for a transformer

- Sarcasm detection. Classical models fail here. Period.
- Long reviews where sentiment shifts mid-document.
- Aspect-based sentiment. "Camera was great but battery was terrible." You need to attribute sentiment to aspects. Transformers or structured output models only.
- Non-English, low-resource languages. Multilingual BERT gives you a zero-shot baseline for free.

If you need any of the above, skip ahead to phase 7 (transformers deep dive). Otherwise, Naive Bayes or logistic regression on TF-IDF plus bigrams plus negation handling is your 2026 production baseline.

### The reproducibility trap (again)

Retraining sentiment models is routine. Re-evaluating them is not. Accuracy numbers reported in papers use specific splits, specific preprocessing, specific tokenizers. If you compare your new model to a baseline without using the identical pipeline, you will get misleading deltas. Always regenerate the baseline on your pipeline, not the paper's number.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/prompt-sentiment-baseline.md`:

```markdown
---
name: sentiment-baseline
description: Design a sentiment analysis baseline for a new dataset.
phase: 5
lesson: 05
---

Given a dataset description (domain, language, size, label granularity, latency budget), you output:

1. Feature extraction recipe. Specify tokenizer, n-gram range, stopword policy (usually keep), negation handling (scoped prefix or bigrams).
2. Classifier. Naive Bayes for baseline, logistic regression for production, transformer only if the domain needs sarcasm / aspects / cross-lingual.
3. Evaluation plan. Report precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, and per-class error samples (not just scalars).
4. One failure mode to monitor post-deployment. Domain drift and sarcasm are the top two.

Refuse to recommend dropping stopwords for sentiment tasks. Refuse to report accuracy as the sole metric when classes are imbalanced (e.g., 90% positive). Flag subword-rich languages as needing FastText or transformer embeddings over word-level TF-IDF.
```


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Polarity | Positive or negative | Binary label; sometimes extended to neutral or fine-grained (5-star). |
| Aspect-based sentiment | Per-aspect polarity | Attribute sentiment to specific entities or attributes mentioned in text. |
| Negation scoping | Reversing nearby tokens | Prefix tokens after "not" with `NOT_` until punctuation. |
| Laplace smoothing | Adding 1 to counts | Prevents zero-probability features in Naive Bayes. |
| L2 regularization | Shrinking weights | Adds `lambda * sum(w^2)` to loss. Essential for sparse text features. |
