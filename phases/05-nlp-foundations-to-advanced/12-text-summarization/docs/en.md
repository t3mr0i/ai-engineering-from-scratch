# Text Summarization

> Extractive systems tell you what the document said. Abstractive systems tell you what the author meant. Different tasks, different pitfalls.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 · 02 (BoW + TF-IDF), Phase 5 · 11 (Machine Translation)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## The Problem

A 2,000-word news article lands in your feed. You need 120 words that capture it. You can either pick the three most important sentences from the article (extractive) or rewrite the content in your own words (abstractive). Both are called summarization. They are completely different problems.

Extractive summarization is a ranking problem. Score every sentence, return the top-`k`. The output is always grammatical because it is lifted verbatim. The risk is missing content that is distributed across the article.

Abstractive summarization is a generation problem. A transformer produces new text conditioned on the input. The output is fluent and compressive but may hallucinate facts that were not in the source. The risk is confident fabrication.

This lesson builds both, with the failure mode each one owns.

## The Concept

![Extractive TextRank vs abstractive transformer](../assets/summarization.svg)

**Extractive.** Treat the article as a graph where nodes are sentences and edges are similarities. Run PageRank (or something like it) over the graph to score sentences by how connected they are to everything else. Highest-scoring sentences are the summary. The canonical implementation is **TextRank** (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

**Abstractive.** Fine-tune a transformer encoder-decoder (BART, T5, Pegasus) on document-summary pairs. At inference, the model reads the document and generates the summary token-by-token via cross-attention. Pegasus in particular uses a gap-sentence pretraining objective that makes it excellent at summarization without much fine-tuning.

Evaluation with **ROUGE** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 score unigram and bigram overlap. ROUGE-L scores longest common subsequence. Higher is better but 40 ROUGE-L is "good" and 50 is "exceptional." Every paper reports all three. Use the `rouge-score` package.


## Use It

The 2026 stack:

| Use case | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| News, 3-5 sentence summary, English | `facebook/bart-large-cnn` |
| Scientific papers | `google/pegasus-pubmed` or a tuned T5 |
| Multi-document, long-form | Any LLM with 32k+ context, prompted |
| Dialog summarization | `philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum` |
| Extractive, low hallucination risk by construction | TextRank or `sumy`'s LSA / LexRank |

LLMs with long context often beat specialized models in 2026 when compute is not a constraint. The tradeoff is cost and reproducibility; specialized models give more consistent outputs.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/skill-summary-picker.md`:

```markdown
---
name: summary-picker
description: Pick extractive or abstractive, named library, factuality check.
version: 1.0.0
phase: 5
lesson: 12
tags: [nlp, summarization]
---

Given a task (document type, compliance requirement, length, compute budget), output:

1. Approach. Extractive or abstractive. Explain in one sentence why.
2. Starting model / library. Name it. `sumy.TextRankSummarizer`, `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, `google/pegasus-pubmed`, or an LLM prompt.
3. Evaluation plan. ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L (use rouge-score with stemming). Plus factuality check if abstractive.
4. One failure mode to probe. Entity swap is the most common in abstractive news summarization; flag samples where source entities do not appear in summary.

Refuse abstractive summarization for medical, legal, financial, or regulated content without a factuality gate. Flag input over the model's context window as needing chunked map-reduce summarization (not just truncation).
```


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Extractive | Pick sentences | Return sentences verbatim from the source. Never hallucinates. |
| Abstractive | Rewrite | Generate new text conditioned on source. Can hallucinate. |
| ROUGE | Summary metric | N-gram / LCS overlap between system output and reference. |
| TextRank | Graph-based extractive | PageRank over sentence similarity graph. |
| Factuality | Is it right | Whether summary claims are supported by the source. |
| Hallucination | Made-up content | Content in the summary that the source does not support. |
