# Information Retrieval and Search

> BM25 is precise but brittle. Dense casts a wide net but misses keywords. Hybrid is the 2026 default. Everything else is tuning.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 · 02 (BoW + TF-IDF), Phase 5 · 04 (GloVe, FastText, Subword)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## The Problem

The user types "what happens if someone lies to get money" and expects to find the statute that actually covers that: "Section 420 IPC." A keyword search misses it entirely (no shared vocabulary). A semantic search misses it if the embeddings were not trained on legal text. Real search has to handle both.

IR is the pipeline under every RAG system, every search bar, every docs site's fuzzy lookup. The 2026 architecture that works in production is not a single method. It is a chain of complementary methods, each catching the failures of the one before.

This lesson builds each piece and names which failures each catches.

## The Concept

![Hybrid retrieval: BM25 + dense + RRF + cross-encoder rerank](../assets/retrieval.svg)

Four layers. Pick the ones you need.

1. **Sparse retrieval (BM25).** Fast, precise on exact matches, terrible on semantics. Run over an inverted index. Sub-10ms per query on millions of documents. Gets you statute references, product codes, error messages, named entities right.
2. **Dense retrieval.** Encode query and documents into vectors. Nearest neighbor search. Captures paraphrases and semantic similarity. Misses exact keyword matches that differ by one character. 50-200ms per query with FAISS or a vector DB.
3. **Fusion.** Merge the ranked lists from sparse and dense. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is the easy default because it ignores raw scores (which live in different scales) and only uses rank positions. Weighted fusion is an option when you know one signal dominates for your domain.
4. **Cross-encoder rerank.** Take the top-30 from fusion. Run a cross-encoder (query + document together, scoring each pair). Keep the top-5. Cross-encoders are slower per pair than bi-encoders but far more accurate. You amortize by only running them on the top-30.

Three-way retrieval (BM25 + dense + learned-sparse like SPLADE) outperforms two-way in 2026 benchmarks but needs infrastructure for learned-sparse indexes. For most teams, two-way plus cross-encoder rerank is the sweet spot.


## Use It

The 2026 stack:

| Scale | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| 1k-100k docs | In-memory BM25 + `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings + RRF. No separate DB. |
| 100k-10M docs | FAISS or pgvector for dense + Elasticsearch / OpenSearch for BM25. Run in parallel. |
| 10M+ docs | Qdrant / Weaviate / Vespa / Milvus with hybrid support. Cross-encoder rerank on top-30. |
| Best-quality frontier | Three-way (BM25 + dense + SPLADE) + ColBERT late-interaction reranking |

Whatever you pick, budget for evaluation. Benchmark retrieval recall before benchmarking end-to-end RAG accuracy. A reader cannot fix what the retriever missed.

### The hard-won lessons from 2026 production RAG

- **80% of RAG failures trace to ingestion and chunking, not the model.** Teams spend weeks swapping LLMs and tuning prompts while the retrieval quietly returns the wrong context every third query. Fix chunking first.
- **Chunking strategy matters more than chunk size.** Fixed-size splits break tables, code, and nested headers. Sentence-aware is the default; semantic or LLM-based chunking pays off for technical docs and product manuals.
- **Parent-doc pattern.** Retrieve small "child" chunks for precision. When multiple children from the same parent section appear, swap in the parent block to preserve context. This consistently lifts answer quality without retraining.
- **k_rerank=3 is usually optimal.** Every extra chunk past that adds token cost and generation latency without lifting answer quality. If k=8 is still better than k=3 for you, the reranker is underperforming.
- **HyDE / query expansion.** Generate a hypothetical answer from the query, embed that, retrieve. Bridges the phrasing gap between short questions and long documents. Free precision lift with no training.
- **Context budget under 8K tokens.** Consistent hits at that limit mean the reranker threshold is too loose.
- **Version everything.** Prompts, chunking rules, embedding model, reranker. Any drift silently breaks answer quality. CI gates on faithfulness, context precision, and unanswered-question rate block regressions before users see them.
- **Three-way retrieval (BM25 + dense + learned-sparse like SPLADE) outperforms two-way** on 2026 benchmarks, especially for queries mixing proper nouns with semantics. Ship it when infrastructure supports SPLADE indexes.

Proper retrieval design reduces hallucinations by 70-90% according to 2026 industry measurements. Most RAG performance gains come from better retrieval, not model fine-tuning.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/skill-retrieval-picker.md`:

```markdown
---
name: retrieval-picker
description: Pick a retrieval stack for a given corpus and query pattern.
version: 1.0.0
phase: 5
lesson: 14
tags: [nlp, retrieval, rag, search]
---

Given requirements (corpus size, query pattern, latency budget, quality bar, infra constraints), output:

1. Stack. BM25 only, dense only, hybrid (BM25 + dense + RRF), hybrid + cross-encoder rerank, or three-way (BM25 + dense + learned-sparse).
2. Dense encoder. Name the specific model. Match to language(s), domain, and context length.
3. Reranker. Name the specific cross-encoder model if used. Flag that rerank adds 30-100ms latency on top-30.
4. Evaluation plan. Recall@10 is the primary retriever metric. MRR for multi-answer. Baseline first, incremental improvements measured against it.

Refuse to recommend dense-only for corpora with named entities, error codes, or product SKUs unless the user has evidence dense handles exact matches. Refuse to skip reranking for high-stakes retrieval (legal, medical) where the final top-5 decides the user's answer.

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| BM25 | Keyword search | Okapi BM25. Scores documents by term frequency, IDF, and length. |
| Dense retrieval | Vector search | Encode query + doc into vectors, find nearest neighbors. |
| Bi-encoder | Embedding model | Encodes query and doc independently. Fast at query time. |
| Cross-encoder | Reranker model | Encodes query + doc together. Slow but accurate. |
| RRF | Rank fusion | Combine two rankings by summing `1/(k + rank)`. |
| Recall@k | Retrieval metric | Fraction of queries where a relevant doc is in the top-k. |
