## Learning Objectives

- Implement logistic regression from scratch using the sigmoid function and binary cross-entropy loss
- Compute and interpret precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix for binary classification
- Explain why MSE fails for classification and why binary cross-entropy produces a convex cost surface
- Build a softmax regression model for multi-class classification and evaluate threshold tuning tradeoffs

## The Problem

You want to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign given its size. You try linear regression. It outputs numbers like 0.3 or 1.7 or -0.5. What do those mean? Is 1.7 "very malignant"? Is -0.5 "very benign"? Linear regression outputs unbounded numbers. Classification needs bounded probabilities between 0 and 1, and a clear decision: yes or no.

Logistic regression solves this. It takes the same linear combination (wx + b) and passes it through the sigmoid function, which squashes any number into the range (0, 1). The output is a probability. You set a threshold (usually 0.5) and make a decision.

This is one of the most widely used algorithms in practice. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. The name comes from the logistic (sigmoid) function it uses.

## The Concept

### Why Linear Regression Fails for Classification

Imagine predicting pass/fail (1/0) based on study hours. Linear regression fits a line through the data:

```
hours:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
actual: 0   0   0   0   1   1   1   1   1   1
```

A linear fit might produce predictions like -0.2 at hour 1 and 1.3 at hour 10. These values are not probabilities. They go below 0 and above 1. Worse, a single outlier (someone who studied 50 hours) would drag the entire line, changing predictions for everyone.

Classification needs a function that:
- Outputs values between 0 and 1 (probabilities)
- Creates a sharp transition (a decision boundary)
- Is not distorted by outliers far from the boundary

### The Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function does exactly this:

```
sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
```

Properties:
- When z is large and positive, sigmoid(z) approaches 1
- When z is large and negative, sigmoid(z) approaches 0
- When z = 0, sigmoid(z) = 0.5
- The output is always between 0 and 1
- The function is smooth and differentiable everywhere

The derivative has a convenient form: sigmoid'(z) = sigmoid(z) * (1 - sigmoid(z)). This makes gradient computation efficient.

### Logistic Regression = Linear Model + Sigmoid

The model computes z = wx + b (same as linear regression), then applies sigmoid:

```mermaid

    X[Input features x] --> L["Linear: z = wx + b"]
    L --> S["Sigmoid: p = 1/(1+e^-z)"]
    S --> D{"p >= 0.5?"}
    D -->|Yes| P[Predict 1]
    D -->|No| N[Predict 0]
```

The output p is interpreted as P(y=1 | x), the probability that the input belongs to class 1. The decision boundary is where wx + b = 0, which makes sigmoid output exactly 0.5.

### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

You cannot use MSE for logistic regression. MSE with a sigmoid creates a non-convex cost surface with many local minima. Instead, use binary cross-entropy (log loss):

```
Loss = -(1/n) * sum(y * log(p) + (1-y) * log(1-p))
```

Why this works:
- When y=1 and p is close to 1: log(1) = 0, so loss is near 0 (correct, low cost)
- When y=1 and p is close to 0: log(0) approaches negative infinity, so loss is huge (wrong, high cost)
- When y=0 and p is close to 0: log(1) = 0, so loss is near 0 (correct, low cost)
- When y=0 and p is close to 1: log(0) approaches negative infinity, so loss is huge (wrong, high cost)

This loss function is convex for logistic regression, guaranteeing a single global minimum.

### Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

The gradients for binary cross-entropy with sigmoid have a clean form:

```
dL/dw = (1/n) * sum((p - y) * x)
dL/db = (1/n) * sum(p - y)
```

These look identical to the linear regression gradients. The difference is that p = sigmoid(wx + b) instead of p = wx + b. The sigmoid introduces the nonlinearity, but the gradient update rule stays the same.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initialize w=0, b=0] --> B[Forward pass: z = wx+b, p = sigmoid z]
    B --> C[Compute loss: binary cross-entropy]
    C --> D["Compute gradients: dw = (1/n) * sum((p-y)*x)"]
    D --> E[Update: w = w - lr*dw, b = b - lr*db]
    E --> F{Converged?}
    F -->|No| B
    F -->|Yes| G[Model trained]
```

### The Decision Boundary

For a 2D input (two features), the decision boundary is the line where:

```
w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b = 0
```

Points on one side get classified as 1, points on the other side as 0. Logistic regression always produces a linear decision boundary. If you need a curved boundary, you either add polynomial features or use a nonlinear model.

### Multi-Class Classification with Softmax

Binary logistic regression handles two classes. For k classes, use the softmax function:

```
softmax(z_i) = e^(z_i) / sum(e^(z_j) for all j)
```

Each class has its own weight vector. The model computes a score z_i for each class, then softmax converts scores to probabilities that sum to 1. The predicted class is the one with the highest probability.

The loss function becomes categorical cross-entropy:

```
Loss = -(1/n) * sum(sum(y_k * log(p_k)))
```

where y_k is 1 for the true class and 0 for all others (one-hot encoding).

### Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy alone is not enough. For a dataset with 95% negative and 5% positive, a model that always predicts negative gets 95% accuracy but is useless.

**Confusion Matrix**:

| | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|---|---|---|
| Actually Positive | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| Actually Negative | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

**Precision**: Of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```

**Recall** (Sensitivity): Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

**F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Balances both metrics.
```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

When to prioritize:
- **Precision**: when false positives are costly (spam filter, you do not want to block legitimate email)
- **Recall**: when false negatives are costly (cancer screening, you do not want to miss a tumor)
- **F1**: when you need a single balanced metric
