# Ensemble Methods

> A group of weak learners, combined correctly, becomes a strong learner. This is not a metaphor. It is a theorem.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Language:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2, Lesson 10 (Bias-Variance Tradeoff)
**Time:** ~120 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Implement AdaBoost and gradient boosting from scratch and explain how boosting sequentially reduces bias
- Build a bagging ensemble and demonstrate how averaging decorrelated models reduces variance without increasing bias
- Compare bagging, boosting, and stacking in terms of what error component each method targets
- Evaluate ensemble diversity and explain why majority voting accuracy improves with more independent weak learners

## The Problem

A single decision tree is fast to train and easy to interpret, but it overfits. A single linear model underfits on complex boundaries. You could spend days engineering the perfect model architecture. Or you could combine a bunch of imperfect models and get something better than any of them individually.

Ensemble methods do exactly this. They are the most reliable technique for winning Kaggle competitions on tabular data, they power most production ML systems, and they illustrate the bias-variance tradeoff in action. Bagging reduces variance. Boosting reduces bias. Stacking learns which models to trust on which inputs.

## The Concept

### Why Ensembles Work

Suppose you have N independent classifiers, each with accuracy p > 0.5. The majority vote has accuracy:

```
P(majority correct) = sum over k > N/2 of C(N,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(N-k)
```

For 21 classifiers each with 60% accuracy, majority vote accuracy is about 74%. With 101 classifiers, it rises to 84%. The errors cancel out when the models make different mistakes.

The key requirement is **diversity**. If all models make the same errors, combining them helps nothing. Ensembles work because they produce diverse models through:

- Different training subsets (bagging)
- Different feature subsets (random forests)
- Sequential error correction (boosting)
- Different model families (stacking)

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Bagging creates diversity by training each model on a different bootstrap sample of the training data.

```mermaid

    D[Training Data] --> B1[Bootstrap Sample 1]
    D --> B2[Bootstrap Sample 2]
    D --> B3[Bootstrap Sample 3]
    D --> BN[Bootstrap Sample N]

    B1 --> M1[Model 1]
    B2 --> M2[Model 2]
    B3 --> M3[Model 3]
    BN --> MN[Model N]

    M1 --> V[Average or Majority Vote]
    M2 --> V
    M3 --> V
    MN --> V

    V --> P[Final Prediction]
```

A bootstrap sample is drawn with replacement from the original data, same size as the original. About 63.2% of unique samples appear in each bootstrap. The remaining 36.8% (out-of-bag samples) provide a free validation set.

Bagging reduces variance without increasing bias much. Each individual tree overfits to its bootstrap sample, but the overfitting is different for each tree, so averaging cancels out the noise.

**Random Forests** are bagging with an extra twist: at each split, only a random subset of features is considered. This forces even more diversity among trees. The typical number of candidate features is `sqrt(n_features)` for classification and `n_features / 3` for regression.

### Boosting (Sequential Error Correction)

Boosting trains models sequentially. Each new model focuses on the examples that previous models got wrong.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D[Data with weights] --> M1[Model 1]
    M1 --> E1[Find errors]
    E1 --> W1[Increase weights on errors]
    W1 --> M2[Model 2]
    M2 --> E2[Find errors]
    E2 --> W2[Increase weights on errors]
    W2 --> M3[Model 3]
    M3 --> F[Weighted sum of all models]
```

Boosting reduces bias. Each new model corrects the systematic errors of the ensemble so far. The final prediction is a weighted sum of all models, where better models get higher weights.

The tradeoff: boosting can overfit if you run too many rounds, because it keeps fitting harder examples, some of which may be noise.

### AdaBoost

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) was the first practical boosting algorithm. It works with any base learner, typically decision stumps (depth-1 trees).

The algorithm:

```
1. Initialize sample weights: w_i = 1/N for all i

2. For t = 1 to T:
   a. Train weak learner h_t on weighted data
   b. Compute weighted error:
      err_t = sum(w_i * I(h_t(x_i) != y_i)) / sum(w_i)
   c. Compute model weight:
      alpha_t = 0.5 * ln((1 - err_t) / err_t)
   d. Update sample weights:
      w_i = w_i * exp(-alpha_t * y_i * h_t(x_i))
   e. Normalize weights to sum to 1

3. Final prediction: H(x) = sign(sum(alpha_t * h_t(x)))
```

Models with lower error get higher alpha. Misclassified samples get higher weights so the next model focuses on them.

### Gradient Boosting

Gradient boosting generalizes boosting to arbitrary loss functions. Instead of reweighting samples, it fits each new model to the residuals (negative gradient of the loss) of the current ensemble.

```
1. Initialize: F_0(x) = argmin_c sum(L(y_i, c))

2. For t = 1 to T:
   a. Compute pseudo-residuals:
      r_i = -dL(y_i, F_{t-1}(x_i)) / dF_{t-1}(x_i)
   b. Fit a tree h_t to the residuals r_i
   c. Find optimal step size:
      gamma_t = argmin_gamma sum(L(y_i, F_{t-1}(x_i) + gamma * h_t(x_i)))
   d. Update:
      F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + learning_rate * gamma_t * h_t(x)

3. Final prediction: F_T(x)
```

For squared error loss, the pseudo-residuals are just the actual residuals: `r_i = y_i - F_{t-1}(x_i)`. Each tree literally fits the errors of the previous ensemble.

The learning rate (shrinkage) controls how much each tree contributes. Smaller learning rates require more trees but generalize better. Typical values: 0.01 to 0.3.

### XGBoost: Why It Dominates Tabular Data

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is gradient boosting with engineering optimizations that make it fast, accurate, and resistant to overfitting:

- **Regularized objective:** L1 and L2 penalties on leaf weights prevent individual trees from being too confident
- **Second-order approximation:** Uses both first and second derivatives of the loss, giving better split decisions
- **Sparsity-aware splits:** Handles missing values natively by learning the best direction for missing data at each split
- **Column subsampling:** Like random forests, samples features at each split for diversity
- **Weighted quantile sketch:** Efficiently finds split points for continuous features on distributed data
- **Cache-aware block structure:** Memory layout optimized for CPU cache lines

For tabular data, XGBoost (and its successor LightGBM) consistently outperforms neural networks. This is not changing anytime soon. If your data fits in a table with rows and columns, start with gradient boosting.

### Stacking (Meta-Learning)

Stacking uses the predictions of multiple base models as features for a meta-learner.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    D[Training Data] --> M1[Model 1: Random Forest]
    D --> M2[Model 2: SVM]
    D --> M3[Model 3: Logistic Regression]

    M1 --> P1[Predictions 1]
    M2 --> P2[Predictions 2]
    M3 --> P3[Predictions 3]

    P1 --> META[Meta-Learner]
    P2 --> META
    P3 --> META

    META --> F[Final Prediction]
```

The meta-learner learns which base model to trust for which inputs. If the random forest is better at certain regions and the SVM at others, the meta-learner will learn to route accordingly.

To avoid data leakage, base model predictions must be generated via cross-validation on the training set. You never train base models and generate meta-features on the same data.

### Voting

The simplest ensemble. Just combine predictions directly.

- **Hard voting:** Majority vote on class labels.
- **Soft voting:** Average predicted probabilities, pick the class with highest average probability. Usually better because it uses confidence information.
