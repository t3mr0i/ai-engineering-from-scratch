# Claude Agent SDK: Subagents and Session Store

> The Claude Agent SDK is the library form of the Claude Code harness. Built-in tools, subagents for context isolation, hooks, W3C trace propagation, session store parity. Claude Managed Agents is the hosted alternative for long-running async work.

**Type:** Learn + Build
**Languages:** Python (stdlib)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 01 (Agent Loop), Phase 14 · 10 (Skill Libraries)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the difference between the Anthropic Client SDK (raw API) and the Claude Agent SDK (harness shape).
- Describe subagents — parallelization and context isolation — and when to reach for them.
- Name the Python SDK's session store surface (`append`, `load`, `list_sessions`, `delete`, `list_subkeys`) and how to capture a session transcript to a file for debugging.
- Implement a stdlib harness with built-in tools, subagent spawning with isolated context, lifecycle hooks, and a session store.

## The Problem

A raw LLM API gets you one round-trip. A production agent needs tool execution, MCP servers, lifecycle hooks, subagent spawning, session persistence, trace propagation. Claude Agent SDK ships this shape as a library — the same harness Claude Code uses, exposed for custom agents.

## The Concept

### Client SDK vs Agent SDK

- **Client SDK (`anthropic`).** Raw Messages API. You own the loop, the tools, the state.
- **Agent SDK (`claude-agent-sdk`).** Built-in tool execution, MCP connections, hooks, subagent spawning, session store. The Claude Code loop as a library.

### Built-in tools

The SDK ships 10+ tools out of the box: file read/write, shell, grep, glob, web fetch, more. Custom tools register via the standard tool-schema interface.

### Subagents

Two purposes documented by Anthropic:

1. **Parallelization.** Run independent work concurrently. "Find the test file for each of these 20 modules" is 20 parallel subagent tasks.
2. **Context isolation.** Subagents use their own context window; only results return to the orchestrator. The orchestrator's budget is preserved.

Python SDK recent additions: `list_subagents()`, `get_subagent_messages()` for reading subagent transcripts.

### Session store

Protocol parity with TypeScript:

- `append(session_id, message)` — add a turn.
- `load(session_id)` — restore conversation.
- `list_sessions()` — enumerate.
- `delete(session_id)` — with cascade to subagent sessions.
- `list_subkeys(session_id)` — list subagent keys.

There is no dedicated "mirror transcript" flag; `--output-format stream-json` redirected to a file captures the transcript as it streams, and `--debug-file` writes diagnostic logs to a file.

### Hooks

Lifecycle hooks you can register:

- `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse` — gate or audit tool calls.
- `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd` — set up and tear down.
- `UserPromptSubmit` — act on user input before the model sees it.
- `PreCompact` — run before context compaction.
- `Stop` — cleanup on agent exit.
- `Notification` — side-channel alerts.

Hooks are how pro-workflow (Phase 14 curriculum reference) and similar systems add cross-cutting behavior.

### W3C trace context

OTel spans active on the caller propagate into the CLI subprocess via W3C trace context headers. The whole multi-process trace shows up as one trace in your backend.

### Claude Managed Agents

The hosted alternative (beta header `managed-agents-2026-04-01`). Long-running async work, built-in prompt caching, built-in compaction. Trade control for managed infrastructure.

### Where this pattern goes wrong

- **Subagent over-spawn.** Spawning 100 subagents for 100 tiny tasks. Overhead dominates. Batch instead.
- **Hook creep.** Every team adds hooks; startup time balloons. Review hooks quarterly.
- **Session bloat.** Sessions accumulate; size grows. Use `list_sessions` + expiry policy.
