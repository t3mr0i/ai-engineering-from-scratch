# Tree of Thoughts and LATS: Deliberate Search

> A single chain-of-thought trajectory has no room to backtrack. ToT (Yao et al., 2023) turns reasoning into a tree with self-evaluation on each node. LATS (Zhou et al., 2024) unifies ToT with ReAct and Reflexion under Monte Carlo Tree Search. Game of 24 goes from 4% (CoT) to 74% (ToT); LATS hits 92.7% pass@1 on HumanEval.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python (stdlib)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 01 (Agent Loop), Phase 14 · 03 (Reflexion)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Frame reasoning as search: nodes are "thoughts," edges are "expansions," value is "how promising."
- Implement a stdlib ToT-style BFS tree search with self-evaluation scoring.
- Extend to a toy LATS MCTS loop with select / expand / simulate / backpropagate.
- Decide when search is worth the token multiplier (Game of 24, code generation) and when a single trajectory is enough (simple Q&A).

## The Problem

Chain-of-thought is a linear walk. If the first step is wrong, every subsequent step works on a bad premise. On Game of 24 (use four digits with + − × ÷ to make 24), GPT-4 CoT hits 4% accuracy. The model picks the wrong subexpression early and cannot recover.

What reasoning needs is the ability to propose multiple candidates, evaluate them, pick the promising ones, and backtrack when dead ends appear. That is search. Tree of Thoughts and LATS are the two canonical formulations.

## The Concept

### Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., NeurIPS 2023)

Each node is a coherent intermediate step ("a thought"). Each node can expand to K child thoughts. The LLM self-evaluates each node with a scoring prompt. Search explores the tree — BFS, DFS, or beam.

```
                     (root: "find 24 from 4 6 4 1")
                    /               |            \
           ("6 - 4 = 2")    ("4 + 1 = 5")    ("4 * 6 = 24")  <- Score: HIGH
              /   \              |                  |
          ...    ...          ...                finish
```

Self-evaluation is the load-bearing piece. The paper shows three variants: `sure / likely / impossible` classification, `1..10` numeric score, and vote among candidates. All three beat CoT substantially on Game of 24 (4% -> 74% with GPT-4).

### LATS (Zhou et al., ICML 2024)

LATS unifies ToT, ReAct, and Reflexion under MCTS. The LLM plays three roles:

- **Policy**: propose candidate next actions (ReAct-style).
- **Value function**: score a partial trajectory (ToT-style self-eval).
- **Self-reflector**: on failure, write a natural-language reflection (Reflexion-style) and use it to reseed future rollouts.

Environment feedback (observations) mixes into the value function so the search is informed by real tool results, not just model opinions. Results at paper time: HumanEval pass@1 92.7% with GPT-4 (SOTA), WebShop average 75.9 with GPT-3.5 (approaching gradient-based fine-tuning).

### MCTS, minimally

Four phases per iteration:

1. **Select** — walk from root to a leaf using UCT (upper confidence bound for trees).
2. **Expand** — generate K children via the policy.
3. **Simulate** — rollout from a child using the policy, score the leaf with the value function (or environment reward).
4. **Backpropagate** — update visit counts and value estimates up the path.

UCT formula: `Q(s, a) + c * sqrt(ln N(s) / N(s, a))`. First term is exploitation; second is exploration. Tune `c` per task.

### The cost reality

Search explodes tokens. ToT on Game of 24 uses 100–1000x the tokens of CoT. LATS is similar. This is not free; reserve search for:

- Tasks where a single trajectory is demonstrably insufficient (Game of 24, complex code).
- Tasks where wall-clock is less important than correctness.
- Tasks with a cheap, reliable value function (unit tests for code, explicit target for math).

If your task has a single right answer and a noisy evaluator, search often makes things worse — it finds a "good-scoring" wrong answer.

### 2026 positioning

Most production agents do not run LATS. They run ReAct with tool-grounded verification (CRITIC, Lesson 05). Search shows up in specialized niches:

- Coding agents that run tests as the value function (HumanEval-style).
- Deep-research agents that explore multiple query paths.
- Planning-heavy workflows inside LangGraph subgraphs.

AlphaEvolve (Lesson 11) is the 2025 extreme: evolutionary search over code, machine-checkable fitness, frontier gains (first 4x4 matmul improvement in 56 years).
