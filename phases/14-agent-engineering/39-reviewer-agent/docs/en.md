# Reviewer Agent: Separate Builder from Marker

> The agent that wrote the code cannot grade it. A reviewer is a second loop with a different system prompt, a different goal, and read-only access to everything the builder produced. The gap between builder and reviewer is where most reliability lives.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python (stdlib)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 38 (Verification Gate)
**Time:** ~55 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- State why the same agent cannot reliably review its own work.
- Build a reviewer agent loop that consumes builder artifacts and emits a structured review report.
- Author a reviewer rubric that grades specific dimensions, not vibes.
- Wire the reviewer into the workbench so the human review step starts from a real artifact.

## The Problem

You ask the agent to fix a bug. It edits four files, runs the tests, and reports done. The verification gate (Phase 14 · 38) confirms acceptance ran and scope held. The gate says `passed: true`. You merge. Two days later you find that the fix solved the wrong half of the bug.

Acceptance is necessary, not sufficient. The reviewer asks the questions acceptance cannot ask: did this solve the right problem? Did it expand scope without flagging it? Did it document assumptions that should have been questioned? Did it leave the workbench in a state the next session can pick up?

## The Concept

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Builder[Builder Agent] --> Artifacts[diff + state + feedback + verdict]
  Artifacts --> Reviewer[Reviewer Agent]
  Reviewer --> Rubric[reviewer_checklist.md]
  Reviewer --> Report[review_report.json]
  Report --> Human[Human Sign-Off]
```

### Reviewer rubric

Five dimensions, each scored 0 to 2.

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Problem fit | Did the change solve the task as stated, not a nearby task? |
| Scope discipline | Were edits confined to the contract or was the contract grown deliberately? |
| Assumptions | Are all hidden assumptions written down somewhere reviewable? |
| Verification quality | Does the acceptance command actually prove the goal, or did it prove a weaker version? |
| Handoff readiness | Could the next session pick up cleanly from the current state? |

Total out of 10. A run below 7 is a soft fail; a run below 5 is a hard fail.

### The reviewer is a separate role, not a separate model

You can run the reviewer with the same model as the builder. The discipline is the role separation: different system prompt, different inputs, no write access to the diff. The change in posture is the change in signal.

### The reviewer cannot edit the diff

The reviewer reads the diff, the state, the feedback, the verdict. It writes a report. It does not patch the diff. If the report says "fix this," the next builder turn does the fix; the reviewer goes back to reviewing. Mixing roles defeats the gap.

### Reviewer rubric versus verification gate

The gate (Phase 14 · 38) checks deterministic facts: did acceptance run, did rules pass, did scope hold. The reviewer makes qualitative judgments: was this the right work, is it documented, is the handoff usable. Both are required.


## Use It

Production patterns:

- **Claude Code subagents.** A reviewer subagent runs after the builder closes a task. It posts a comment on the PR with the rubric scores.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK handoffs.** Builder hands off to Reviewer on task completion. Reviewer can hand back with a list of findings or up to a human.
- **Two-model pairing.** Builder runs on a faster cheaper model. Reviewer runs on a stronger model with smaller context, focused on judgment.

The reviewer is the second pair of eyes the workbench grows when humans cannot do every review themselves.

## Ship It

`outputs/skill-reviewer-agent.md` generates a project-specific reviewer rubric, a reviewer agent stub wired to the builder's artifacts, and an integration with the verification gate so human review starts from a written report instead of a blank page.


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| Reviewer rubric | "Checklist" | Five-dimension 0-2 scoring with a written question per dimension |
| Soft fail | "Needs revisions" | Total below 7; builder gets findings to address |
| Hard fail | "Reject" | Total below 5 or any dimension at 0; halt and surface to human |
| Role separation | "Different prompt" | Same model can be both roles; the discipline is inputs and posture |
| Confidence floor | "Don't ship low-signal reports" | Refuse to emit a verdict when the rubric is uncertain |
