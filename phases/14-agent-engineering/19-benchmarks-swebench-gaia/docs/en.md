# Benchmarks: SWE-bench, GAIA, AgentBench

> Three benchmarks anchor agent evaluation in 2026. SWE-bench tests code patching. GAIA tests generalist tool use. AgentBench tests multi-environment reasoning. Know their composition, their contamination story, and what they do not measure.

**Type:** Learn
**Languages:** Python (stdlib)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 06 (Tool Use)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Name SWE-bench's test harness (FAIL_TO_PASS) and explain why it gates on unit tests.
- Explain why SWE-bench Verified (OpenAI, 500 tasks) exists and what it removes.
- Describe GAIA's design: simple for humans, hard for AI; three difficulty levels.
- Name AgentBench's eight environments and its primary blocker for open-source LLMs.
- Summarize the SWE-bench+ contamination finding and its implications.

## The Problem

Leaderboards tell you which model wins on one benchmark. They do not tell you:

- Whether the benchmark is contaminated (solutions in training data, test leakage).
- Whether the benchmark measures what you care about (code vs browsing vs generalist).
- Whether the evaluator is robust (AST matching, state checks, human review).

Know the three anchoring benchmarks and their failure modes before you quote a number.

## The Concept

### SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., ICLR 2024 oral)

- 2,294 real GitHub issues from 12 popular Python repos.
- Agent gets: the codebase at the pre-fix commit + natural-language issue description.
- Agent produces: a patch.
- Evaluator: apply patch, run the repo's test suite. The patch must flip FAIL_TO_PASS tests (previously failing, now passing) without breaking PASS_TO_PASS tests.

SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024) hit 12.5% at release by emphasizing agent-computer interfaces (file editor commands, search syntax the model understands).

### SWE-bench Verified

OpenAI, Aug 2024. Human-curated 500-task subset. Removes ambiguous issues, unreliable tests, and tasks where the fix was unclear. Primary benchmark for "does your agent ship real patches?"

### Contamination

- Over 94% of SWE-bench issues predate most model cutoffs.
- **SWE-bench+** found 32.67% of successful patches leaked solutions in the issue text (model saw the fix in the description), and 31.08% were suspicious due to weak test coverage.
- Verified is cleaner but not contamination-free.

**Hypothetical example.** A model reported at 50% on SWE-bench could score 35% on a separately audited variant. Always name the exact benchmark and split instead of transferring a score between them.

### GAIA (Mialon et al., Nov 2023)

- 466 questions; 300 retained for the private leaderboard at huggingface.co/gaia-benchmark.
- Design philosophy: "conceptually simple for humans (92%) but hard for AI (GPT-4 with plugins: 15%)."
- Tests reasoning, multi-modality, web, tool use.
- Three difficulty levels; Level 3 requires long tool chains across modalities.

GAIA is what you run to measure "generalist capability." Do not confuse with code-specific benchmarks.

### AgentBench (Liu et al., ICLR 2024)

- 8 environments across code (Bash, DB, KG), games (Alfworld, LTP), web (WebShop, Mind2Web), and open-ended generation.
- Multi-turn, ~4k-13k turns per split.
- Primary finding: long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following are the blockers for OSS LLMs catching up to commercial.

### What these do not measure

- Real-world operational cost (tokens, wall-clock).
- Safety behavior in adversarial conditions.
- Performance on your domain (use your own evals, Lesson 30).
- Tail failures (benchmarks average; production operators care about the worst 1%).

### Where benchmarking goes wrong

- **Single-number fixation.** SWE-bench 50% tells you less than the P50/P75/P95 cost + step distribution.
- **Contaminated claims.** Reporting SWE-bench without mentioning Verified or SWE-bench+ is misleading.
- **Benchmark-as-development-target.** Optimizing for the benchmark diverges from production usefulness.
