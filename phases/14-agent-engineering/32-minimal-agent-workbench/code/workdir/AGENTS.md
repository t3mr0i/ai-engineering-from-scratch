# AGENTS.md

This repo runs with a workbench. Read these before acting:

1. `agent_state.json` — where the last session stopped.
2. `task_board.json` — what is in flight, what is next.
3. `docs/agent-rules.md` — startup, scope, definition of done (load on demand).

Definition of done: the task referenced by `agent_state.active_task_id` has
`status == "done"` on `task_board.json` and the verification command listed in
its `acceptance` has exited 0.

Verification command: `python3 -m pytest -x`
