# Repo Memory and Durable State

> Chat history is volatile. The repo is durable. The workbench stores agent state in versioned files so the next session, the next agent, and the next reviewer all read from the same source of truth.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 32 (Minimal Workbench)
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Define what belongs in repo memory and what belongs in chat history.
- Author JSON Schemas for `agent_state.json` and `task_board.json`.
- Build a state manager that loads, validates, mutates, and persists state atomically.
- Use the schema to refuse bad writes before they corrupt the workbench.

## The Problem

The agent finishes a session. The chat closes. The next session opens and asks where to start. The model says "let me check the files," reads stale notes, and re-does work that was already complete. Or worse, it rewrites a finished file because no one told it the file was finished.

The workbench fix is repo memory: state lives in JSON files in the repo, written under a schema, persisted atomically, diff-friendly in code review. Chat is a transient feed; the repo is the system of record.

## The Concept

```mermaid

  Agent[Agent Loop] --> Manager[StateManager]
  Manager --> Schema[agent_state.schema.json]
  Schema --> Validate{valid?}
  Validate -- yes --> Write[agent_state.json]
  Validate -- no --> Reject[refuse + raise]
  Write --> Manager
```

### What belongs in repo memory

| Belongs | Does not belong |
|---------|-----------------|
| Active task id | Raw chat transcripts |
| Touched files this session | Token-level reasoning traces |
| Assumptions the agent made | "The user seemed frustrated" |
| Open blockers | Sampled completions |
| Next action | Vendor-specific model ids |

The test is durability: would this be useful three months from now in a CI rerun? If yes, repo. If no, telemetry.

### Schema-first state

JSON Schema is the contract. Without it, every agent invents new fields, every reviewer learns a new shape, and every CI script has to special-case past versions. With it, a bad write is a refused write.

The schema covers:

- Required keys.
- Allowed `status` values.
- Forbidden values (e.g. `null` for arrays).
- Pattern constraints (task ids match `T-\d{3,}`).
- Version field for migrations.

### Atomic writes

State writes need to survive partial failures: write to a tempfile, fsync, rename over the target. The state file is the source of truth; a half-written one is worse than no file at all.

### Migrations

When the schema changes, ship a migration script next to the schema bump. The state file carries a `schema_version` field; the manager refuses to load a file from a version it cannot migrate.
