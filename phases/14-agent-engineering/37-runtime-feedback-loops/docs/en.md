# Runtime Feedback Loops

> Agents that do not see real command output guess. A feedback runner captures stdout, stderr, exit code, and timing into a structured record the next turn can read. Then the agent reacts to facts instead of to its own prediction of facts.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 14 · 32 (Minimal Workbench), Phase 14 · 35 (Init Script)
**Time:** ~50 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish runtime feedback from observability telemetry.
- Build a feedback runner that wraps shell commands and persists structured records.
- Truncate large outputs deterministically so the loop stays within token budget.
- Refuse to advance the loop when feedback is missing.

## The Problem

The agent says "running tests now." The next message says "all tests pass." The reality is that no test ran. The agent imagined the output, or it ran the command and never read the result, or it read the result and silently truncated the failure line.

A feedback runner removes that gap. Every command goes through the runner. Every record carries the command, the captured stdout and stderr, the exit code, the wall-clock duration, and a one-line agent note. The agent reads the record at the next turn. The verification gate reads the records at the end of the task.

## The Concept

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Agent[Agent Loop] --> Runner[run_with_feedback.py]
  Runner --> Shell[subprocess]
  Shell --> Capture[stdout / stderr / exit / duration]
  Capture --> Record[feedback_record.jsonl]
  Record --> Agent
  Record --> Gate[Verification Gate]
```

### What goes in a feedback record

| Field | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| `command` | Exact argv, no shell expansion surprises |
| `stdout_tail` | Last N lines, deterministic truncation |
| `stderr_tail` | Last N lines, separate from stdout |
| `exit_code` | The unambiguous success signal |
| `duration_ms` | Surfaces slow probes and runaway processes |
| `started_at` | Timestamp for replay |
| `agent_note` | One line the agent writes about what it expected |

### Truncation is deterministic

A 50 MB log destroys the loop. The runner truncates head and tail with a `...truncated N lines...` marker, deterministic so the same output always produces the same record. No sampling; the parts the agent needs to see (final error, final summary) live at the tail.

### Feedback versus telemetry

Telemetry (Phase 14 · 23, OTel GenAI conventions) is for human operators reviewing runs across time. Feedback is for the next turn of this run. They share fields but they live in different files with different retention.

### Refuse to advance without feedback

If the runner errors before capturing exit, the record carries `exit_code: null` and `error: <reason>`. The agent loop must refuse to claim success on a `null` exit. No exit, no progress.

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Distinguish runtime feedback from observability telemetry.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Build a feedback runner that wraps shell commands and persists structured records.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Truncate large outputs deterministically so the loop stays within token budget.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.py](../code/main.py) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Distinguish runtime feedback from observability telemetry,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Truncate large outputs deterministically so the loop stays within token budget,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.
