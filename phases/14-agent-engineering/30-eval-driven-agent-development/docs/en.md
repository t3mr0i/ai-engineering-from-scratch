# Eval-Driven Agent Development

> Anthropic's guidance: "start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when needed." Evaluation is not the last step. It's the outer loop that drives every other choice in Phase 14.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** All of Phase 14.
**Time:** ~60 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Name the three evaluation layers — static benchmarks, custom offline, online production — and what each is for.
- Explain the evaluator-optimizer tight loop.
- Describe the 2026 best practice: evals live next to code, run in CI, gate PRs.
- Connect every Phase 14 lesson to the eval case it generates.

## The Problem

Agents pass demos. They fail in production in ways demos cannot predict. Benchmarks answer "is this model broadly capable?" not "is this agent shipping the right patches for my product?" The answer: evaluation at three layers, running continuously, with every guardrail and learned rule mapped to an eval case.

## The Concept

### Three evaluation layers

1. **Static benchmarks** — SWE-bench Verified for code (Lesson 19), WebArena/OSWorld for browsing / desktop (Lesson 20), GAIA for generalist (Lesson 19), BFCL V4 for tool use (Lesson 06). Use for cross-model comparison and regression gating. The [SWE-bench+ audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06992) found solution leakage in 32.67% of the successful patches it manually screened, so always name the exact benchmark and audit status.

2. **Custom offline evals** — your product's shape:
   - LLM-as-judge (Langfuse, Phoenix, Opik — Lesson 24).
   - Execution-based (run the patch, check tests).
   - Trajectory-based (compare action sequences against gold; OSWorld-Human shows top agents 1.4-2.7x over gold).

3. **Online evals** — production:
   - Session replays (Langfuse).
   - Guardrail-triggered alerts (Lesson 16, 21).
   - Per-step cost / latency tracking (Lesson 23 OTel spans).

### Evaluator-optimizer (Anthropic)

The tight loop:

1. Proposer generates output.
2. Evaluator judges.
3. Refine until evaluator passes.

This is Self-Refine (Lesson 05) generalized. Any agent flow you care about can wrap in evaluator-optimizer for reliability.

### 2026 best practice

- Evals live next to code.
- Run in CI on every PR.
- Gate merge on eval scores (e.g. "no regression > 5% vs main").
- Every guardrail maps to an eval case.
- Every learned rule (Reflexion, pro-workflow learn-rule) maps to a failure case.

### Where eval-driven development fails

- **No baseline.** Evals without a last-known-good are unreadable. Store baselines.
- **LLM-judge without grounding.** Judges hallucinate too. CRITIC pattern (Lesson 05) — judge grounds on external tools.
- **Over-fitting to evals.** Optimizing for the eval diverges from production usefulness. Rotate cases.
- **Flaky evals.** Non-deterministic cases cause false alarms. Pin seeds, snapshot state.
