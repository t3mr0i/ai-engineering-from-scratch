# StyleGAN

> Most generators stir `z` into every layer at the same time. StyleGAN split it apart: first map `z` to an intermediate `w`, then *inject* `w` at every resolution level through AdaIN. That single change untangled the latent space and made photorealistic faces a solved problem for seven years running.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 8 · 03 (GANs), Phase 4 · 08 (Normalization), Phase 3 · 07 (CNNs)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## The Problem

A DCGAN maps `z` to an image through a stack of transposed convolutions. The problem: `z` controls everything — pose, lighting, identity, background — entangled together. Move along one axis of `z`, all four change. You cannot ask the model "same person, different pose" because the representation does not factor that way.

Karras et al. (2019, NVIDIA) proposed: stop feeding `z` directly into conv layers. Feed a constant `4×4×512` tensor as the network input. Learn an 8-layer MLP that maps `z ∈ Z → w ∈ W`. Inject `w` at every resolution via *adaptive instance normalization* (AdaIN): normalize each conv feature map, then scale and shift by affine projections of `w`. Add per-layer noise for stochastic detail (skin pores, hair strands).

The result: `W` has roughly orthogonal axes for "high-level style" (pose, identity) vs "fine style" (lighting, color). You can swap styles between two images by using image A's `w` for the low-resolution levels and image B's `w` for the high. This unlocked editing, cross-domain stylization, and the entire "StyleGAN-inversion" line of research.

## The Concept

![StyleGAN: mapping network + AdaIN + per-layer noise](../assets/stylegan.svg)

**Mapping network.** `f: Z → W`, an 8-layer MLP. `Z = N(0, I)^512`. `W` is not forced to be Gaussian — it learns a data-adapted shape.

**Synthesis network.** Starts from a learned constant `4×4×512`. Each resolution block: `upsample → conv → AdaIN(w_i) → noise → conv → AdaIN(w_i) → noise`. Resolutions double: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.

**AdaIN.**

```
AdaIN(x, y) = y_scale · (x - mean(x)) / std(x) + y_bias
```

where `y_scale` and `y_bias` come from affine projections of `w`. Normalize per feature map, then restyle. "Style" here is the first- and second-order statistics of the feature map.

**Per-layer noise.** Single-channel Gaussian noise added to each feature map, scaled by a learned per-channel factor. Controls stochastic detail without affecting global structure.

**Truncation trick.** At inference, sample `z`, compute `w = mapping(z)`, then `w' = ŵ + ψ·(w - ŵ)` where `ŵ` is the mean `w` over many samples. `ψ < 1` trades diversity for quality. Almost every StyleGAN demo uses `ψ ≈ 0.7`.

## StyleGAN 1 → 2 → 3

| Version | Year | Innovation |
|---------|------|------------|
| StyleGAN | 2019 | Mapping network + AdaIN + noise + progressive growing. |
| StyleGAN2 | 2020 | Weight demodulation replaces AdaIN (fixes droplet artifacts); skip/residual architecture; path-length regularization. |
| StyleGAN3 | 2021 | Alias-free convolution + equivariant kernels; eliminates texture sticking to pixel grid. |
| StyleGAN-XL | 2022 | Class-conditional, 1024², ImageNet. |
| R3GAN | 2024 | Rebrands with stronger reg; closes gap to diffusion on FFHQ-1024 with 20x fewer params. |

In 2026 StyleGAN3 remains the default for (a) narrow-domain photorealism at high FPS, (b) few-shot domain adaptation (train on a new dataset with 100 images, freeze mapping), (c) inversion-based editing (find the `w` that reconstructs a real photo, then edit that `w`). For open-domain text-to-image, it is not the tool — diffusion is.
