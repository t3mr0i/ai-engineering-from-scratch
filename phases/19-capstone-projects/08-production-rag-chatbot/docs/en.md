# Capstone 08 — Production RAG Chatbot for a Regulated Vertical

> Harvey, Glean, Mendable, and LlamaCloud all run the same production shape in 2026. Ingest with docling or Unstructured and ColPali for visuals. Hybrid search. Re-rank with bge-reranker-v2-gemma. Synthesize with Claude Sonnet 4.7 using prompt caching at 60-80% hit rate. Guard with Llama Guard 4 and NeMo Guardrails. Watch with Langfuse and Phoenix. Grade with RAGAS on a 200-question golden set. Build one in a regulated domain (legal, clinical, insurance), and the capstone is passing the golden set, the red team, and the drift dashboard.

**Type:** Capstone
**Languages:** Python (pipeline + API), TypeScript (chat UI)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5 (NLP), Phase 7 (transformers), Phase 11 (LLM engineering), Phase 12 (multimodal), Phase 17 (infrastructure), Phase 18 (safety)
**Phases exercised:** P5 · P7 · P11 · P12 · P17 · P18
**Time:** 30 hours

## Problem

Regulated-domain RAG (legal contracts, clinical trial protocols, insurance policies) is the most-shipped production shape of 2026 because the ROI is obvious and the stakes are concrete. Harvey (Allen & Overy) built it for legal. Mendable ships the developer-docs flavor. Glean covers enterprise search. The pattern is: ingest high-fidelity, retrieve hybrid with rerank, synthesize with citation enforcement and prompt caching, guard with multiple safety layers, and monitor drift continuously.

The hard parts are not the model. They are jurisdiction-aware compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2), citation-level auditability, cost control (prompt caching buys 60-90% discount when hit rate is high), hallucination detection via RAGAS faithfulness, and drift detection when the source documents get updated without the index catching up. This capstone asks you to ship all of it on a 200-question golden set with a red-team suite alongside.

## Concept

The pipeline has two sides. **Ingestion**: docling or Unstructured parses structured documents; ColPali handles visually rich ones; chunks get summaries, tags, and role-based access labels. Vectors go into pgvector + pgvectorscale (under 50M vectors) or Qdrant Cloud; sparse BM25 runs alongside. **Conversation**: LangGraph handles memory and multi-turn; each query runs hybrid retrieval, reranks with bge-reranker-v2-gemma-2b, synthesizes with Claude Sonnet 4.7 (prompt-cached), passes output through Llama Guard 4 and NeMo Guardrails, and emits a citation-anchored response.

The eval stack has four layers. **Golden set** (200 labeled Q/A with citations) for correctness. **Red team** (jailbreaks, PII extraction attempts, off-domain questions) for safety. **RAGAS** for faithfulness / answer relevance / context precision automatically per-turn. **Drift dashboard** (Arize Phoenix) watching retrieval quality and hallucination score weekly.

Prompt caching is the cost lever. Claude 4.5+ and GPT-5+ support caching system prompts + retrieved context. At 60-80% hit rate, per-query cost drops 3-5x. The pipeline must be designed for stable prefixes (system prompt + reranked context first) to achieve high cache hit rates.

## Stack

- Ingestion: Unstructured.io or docling for structured documents; ColPali for visually-rich PDFs
- Vector DB: pgvector + pgvectorscale under 50M vectors; Qdrant Cloud otherwise
- Sparse: Tantivy BM25 with field weights
- Orchestration: LlamaIndex Workflows (ingestion) + LangGraph (conversation)
- Re-ranker: bge-reranker-v2-gemma-2b self-hosted or Voyage rerank-2 hosted
- LLM: Claude Sonnet 4.7 with prompt caching; fallback Llama 3.3 70B self-hosted
- Eval: RAGAS 0.2 online, DeepEval for hallucination and jailbreak suites
- Observability: Langfuse self-hosted with annotation queue; Arize Phoenix for drift
- Guardrails: Llama Guard 4 input/output classifier, NeMo Guardrails v0.12 policy, Presidio PII scrub
- Compliance: role-based access labels on chunks; jurisdiction tags for GDPR/HIPAA


## Use It

```
$ chat --role=analyst --jurisdiction=GDPR
> what is the data-retention obligation for EU user profiles under our contract?
[retrieve]  hybrid top-20 filtered to GDPR + analyst-role
[rerank]    top-5 kept
[synth]     claude-sonnet-4.7, cache hit 74%, 0.8s
answer:
  The contract (Section 12.4, Master Services Agreement dated 2024-03-11)
  obligates EU user profile deletion within 30 days of termination per GDPR
  Article 17. The DPA amendment (DPA-v2.1, Section 5) extends this to 14 days
  for "restricted" category data.
  citations: [MSA-2024-03-11 s12.4, DPA-v2.1 s5]
