# Capstone 87 — End-to-End Safety Gate

> Pre-gen, during-gen, post-gen. Three checkpoints, one verdict, an audit trail per request.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 18 safety lessons, Phase 19 Track A lessons 25-29
**Time:** ~90 min

## Problem

Lessons 82-86 in this track each shipped a single piece: a taxonomy, an input detector, an evaluation framework, an output classifier, a rules engine. A real safety gate has to compose them, run them at the right moment in the request lifecycle, decide what action to take when they disagree, and produce a trace a reviewer can read on Monday morning. The composition is the lesson.

The gate sits at three checkpoints. Pre-gen runs before the model is called: the detector from lesson 83 looks at the prompt and either passes it, blocks it outright (high-confidence attack), or attaches a flag for downstream layers to weigh. During-gen runs as the model emits tokens: a streaming filter buffers chunks and terminates the stream early if a forbidden phrase appears (prefix-injection survives this if the gate only looks post-hoc). Post-gen runs after the model finishes: the classifier router from lesson 85 and the rules engine from lesson 86 inspect the full output, the gate aggregates their verdicts with the pre-gen signal, and the gate applies a final action.

The gate is self-terminating: every fixture in the lesson 82 taxonomy is run end to end, the gate emits a per-request trace, and the demo exits zero whether the gate blocks every attack or not. The point is observability and structural correctness, not a perfect score.

## Concept

Three checkpoints, one decision tree.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  IN[user prompt] --> PG[pre-gen: detector]
  PG -->|block on high| OUT1[refusal + trace]
  PG --> M[mock LLM]
  M -->|stream| DG[during-gen: token filter]
  DG -->|terminate early| OUT2[partial + trace]
  DG -->|complete| POST[post-gen: classifier + rules]
  POST --> AGG[aggregate]
  AGG --> OUT3[final action + trace]
```

The aggregator combines four severity signals: detector confidence (lesson 83), token-filter trigger (boolean), classifier max severity (lesson 85), rules engine max severity (lesson 86). The aggregation function is a deterministic table.

| Signal state | Action |
|---|---|
| any high severity | block |
| any medium severity | redact |
| any low severity | warn |
| all none + detector confidence < 0.5 | allow |
| detector confidence 0.5-0.85, no other signal | warn |

Block returns a refusal. Redact ships the classifier-redacted text and applies the rules-engine fixer. Warn ships the original with a soft notice. Allow ships the original. Each request emits a `RequestTrace` with `request_id`, `prompt`, `pre_gen` (detector verdict), `during_gen` (token-filter trigger), `post_gen` (classifier action + rules report), `final_action`, `final_output`, and `latency_ms`.

The during-gen filter is a streaming abstraction. The mock LLM yields chunks (4 tokens each by default). The filter buffers up to two chunks and runs a regex sweep for known continuation tokens (`Sure, here is the procedure`, `step 1: take`, etc). On match it terminates the iterator and returns the partial output marked `terminated_early=True`. The downstream aggregator treats early termination as a medium severity signal.

The mock LLM has two behaviors keyed off the prompt: it refuses recognizable attacks (returns `I cannot ...`) and answers benign prompts (returns a generic helpful string). For a small subset of attacks (notably encoding tricks not caught by the input pipeline) it produces a partial harmful continuation that the during-gen filter is supposed to catch. This is intentional. The gate's value is in the layered defense; the demo shows the layers interact correctly.
