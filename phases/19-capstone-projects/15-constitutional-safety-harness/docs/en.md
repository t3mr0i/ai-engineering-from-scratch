# Capstone 15 — Constitutional Safety Harness + Red-Team Range

> Anthropic's Constitutional Classifiers, Meta's Llama Guard 4, Google's ShieldGemma-2, NVIDIA's Nemotron 3 Content Safety, and X-Guard for multilingual coverage defined the 2026 safety-classifier stack. garak, PyRIT, NVIDIA Aegis, and promptfoo became the standard adversarial evaluation tools. NeMo Guardrails v0.12 ties them into a production pipeline. This capstone wires all of it together: a layered safety harness around a target app, an autonomous red-team agent running 6+ attack families, and a constitutional self-critique run that produces a measurable harmlessness delta.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 10 (LLMs from scratch), Phase 11 (LLM engineering), Phase 13 (tools), Phase 14 (agents), Phase 18 (ethics, safety, alignment)
**Phases exercised:** P10 · P11 · P13 · P14 · P18
**Time:** 25 hours

## Learning Objectives

- Define measurable acceptance criteria for Capstone 15 — Constitutional Safety Harness + Red-Team Range
- Integrate the required components into one self-terminating workflow
- Exercise happy paths, edge cases, and failure recovery with reproducible fixtures
- Package the verified result as a reusable curriculum artifact

## Problem

The frontier of LLM safety in 2026 is not whether classifiers work (they do, roughly) but how to compose them correctly around a production app without over-refusing or leaving obvious holes. Llama Guard 4 handles English policy violations. X-Guard (132 languages) handles multilingual jailbreak. ShieldGemma-2 catches image-based prompt injection. NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Content Safety covers enterprise categories. Anthropic's Constitutional Classifiers are a separate approach used during training rather than serving.

Attack evolution matters too. PAIR and TAP automate jailbreak discovery. GCG runs gradient-based suffix attacks. Multi-turn and code-switch attacks exploit agent memory. Any deployed LLM needs a red-team range — garak and PyRIT are the canonical drivers — plus documented mitigations and CVSS-scored findings.

You will harden a target application (either an 8B instruction-tuned model or one of the RAG chatbots from other capstones), run 6+ attack families against it, and produce a before/after harmlessness measurement.

## Concept

The safety pipeline is five layers. **Input sanitize**: strip zero-width chars, decode base64/rot13, normalize Unicode. **Policy layer**: NeMo Guardrails v0.12 rails (off-domain, toxicity, PII extraction). **Classifier gate**: Llama Guard 4 on input, X-Guard on non-English, ShieldGemma-2 on image inputs. **Model**: the target LLM. **Output filter**: Llama Guard 4 on output, Presidio PII scrub, citation enforcement where applicable. **HITL tier**: outputs flagged high-risk go to a Slack queue.

The red-team range runs on a scheduler. PAIR and TAP autonomously discover jailbreaks. GCG runs gradient-based suffix attacks. ASCII / base64 / rot13 encoding attacks. Multi-turn attacks (persona adoption, memory exploitation). Code-switch attacks (mix English with Swahili or Thai). Each run produces a structured findings file with CVSS scoring and disclosure timeline.

The constitutional-self-critique run is a training-time intervention. Take 1k harmful-attempt prompts, have the model draft a response, critique it against a written constitution (do-not-harm rules), and retrain on the critique loop. Measure the before/after harmlessness delta on a held-out eval.
