# Capstone 03 — Real-Time Voice Assistant (ASR to LLM to TTS)

> A voice agent that feels right has end-to-end latency under 800ms, knows when you have stopped talking, handles barge-in, and can call a tool without stalling. Retell, Vapi, LiveKit Agents, and Pipecat all hit this bar in 2026. They do it with the same shape: a streaming ASR, a turn-detector, a streaming LLM, and a streaming TTS, all wired through WebRTC with aggressive latency budgets at every hop. Build one, measure WER and MOS and false-cutoff rate, and run it under packet loss.

**Type:** Capstone
**Languages:** Python (agent + pipeline), TypeScript (web client)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 (speech and audio), Phase 7 (transformers), Phase 11 (LLM engineering), Phase 13 (tools), Phase 14 (agents), Phase 17 (infrastructure)
**Phases exercised:** P6 · P7 · P11 · P13 · P14 · P17
**Time:** 30 hours

## Problem

Voice has been the fastest-moving AI UX category of 2025-2026. The technical ceiling dropped each quarter. OpenAI Realtime API, Gemini 2.5 Live, Cartesia Sonic-2, ElevenLabs Flash v3, LiveKit Agents 1.0, and Pipecat 0.0.70 all put sub-800ms first-audio-out within reach. The bar is not latency alone. It is the interaction feel: not cutting the user off, not getting cut off, recovering from a mid-sentence interruption, calling a tool mid-conversation without stalling the audio, surviving jittery mobile networks.

You cannot get there by stitching three REST calls. The architecture is pipelined streaming end to end. Build it and the failure modes become visible: a VAD tuned for phone audio firing on background TV, a turn-detector waiting for punctuation that never comes, a TTS that buffers 400ms before emitting. The capstone is to fix these one at a time under load and publish a latency-and-quality report.

## Concept

The pipeline has five streaming stages: **audio in** (WebRTC from browser or PSTN), **ASR** (streaming partial transcripts from Deepgram Nova-3 or faster-whisper), **turn detection** (VAD plus a small turn-detector model that reads partial transcripts for completion cues), **LLM** (streaming tokens as soon as the turn is judged complete), **TTS** (streaming audio out within ~200ms of the first LLM token).

Three cross-cutting concerns. **Barge-in**: when the user starts speaking while the agent is speaking, the TTS cancels and the ASR picks up immediately. **Tool use**: mid-conversation function calls (weather, calendar) must run on a side channel without stalling the audio; the agent pre-fills an acknowledgement token ("one second...") if latency exceeds 300ms. **Backpressure**: under packet loss, partial transcripts are held, VAD raises the speech-gate threshold, and the agent avoids speaking over an unacknowledged message.

The measurement bar is quantitative. WER under 8% on the Hamming VAD benchmark at 15 dB SNR. First-audio-out p50 under 800ms on 100 measured calls. False-cutoff rate under 3%. MOS above 4.2 on TTS. 50 concurrent calls on a single g5.xlarge. These numbers are the deliverable.

## Stack

- Transport: LiveKit Agents 1.0 (WebRTC) plus Twilio PSTN gateway; Pipecat 0.0.70 as the alternate framework
- ASR: Deepgram Nova-3 (streaming, sub-300ms first partial) or faster-whisper Whisper-v3-turbo self-hosted
- VAD: Silero VAD v5 plus the LiveKit turn-detector (small transformer that reads partial transcripts)
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o-realtime for tight integration, Gemini 2.5 Flash Live, or cascaded Claude Haiku 4.5 (streaming completions, separate audio path)
- TTS: Cartesia Sonic-2 (lowest first-byte), ElevenLabs Flash v3, or open-source Orpheus for self-host
- Tools: FastMCP side-channel for weather/calendar/booking; agent pre-emits filler if tool takes >300ms
- Observability: OpenTelemetry voice spans, Langfuse voice traces with audio replay
- Deployment: single g5.xlarge (24GB VRAM) for self-hosted Whisper + Orpheus; hosted APIs for lowest latency
