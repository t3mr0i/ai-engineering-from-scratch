# Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard

> Langfuse went open-core. Arize Phoenix published the 2026 GenAI semconv mappings. Helicone and Braintrust both doubled down on per-user cost attribution. Traceloop's OpenLLMetry became the de-facto SDK instrumentation. The production shape is ClickHouse for traces, Postgres for metadata, Next.js for UI, and a small army of eval jobs (DeepEval, RAGAS, LLM-judge) running over sampled traces. Build one self-hosted, ingest from at least four SDK families, and demonstrate catching an injected regression in under five minutes.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 11 (LLM engineering), Phase 13 (tools), Phase 17 (infrastructure), Phase 18 (safety)
**Phases exercised:** P11 · P13 · P17 · P18
**Time:** 25 hours

## Learning Objectives

- Define measurable acceptance criteria for Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard
- Integrate the required components into one self-terminating workflow
- Exercise happy paths, edge cases, and failure recovery with reproducible fixtures
- Package the verified result as a reusable curriculum artifact

## Problem

Every AI team running production traffic in 2026 keeps an observability plane alongside the model. Cost attribution. Hallucination detection. Drift monitoring. Jailbreak signal. SLO dashboards. PII leak alerts. The open-source references — Langfuse, Phoenix, OpenLLMetry — converged on OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions as the ingest schema. You can now instrument OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and vLLM with one SDK and ship compatible spans.

You will build a self-hosted dashboard that ingests from at least four SDK families, runs a small set of eval jobs over sampled traces, detects drift, and alerts. The measurement bar: given a deliberately injected regression (a prompt that starts producing PII), the dashboard catches it and fires an alert in under five minutes.

## Concept

Ingest is OTLP HTTP. The SDK produces GenAI-semconv spans: `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.response.id`, `llm.prompts`, `llm.completions`. Spans land in ClickHouse for columnar analytics; metadata (users, sessions, apps) lands in Postgres.

Evals run as batch jobs over sampled traces. DeepEval scores faithfulness, toxicity, and answer relevance. RAGAS scores retrieval metrics when the trace carries retrieval context. Custom LLM-judges run domain-specific checks (PII leak, off-policy response). Eval runs write back to the same ClickHouse as eval spans linked to the parent trace.

Drift detection watches embedding-space distributions over time (PSI or KL divergence on prompt embeddings) plus eval-score trends. Alerts feed Prometheus Alertmanager and then Slack / PagerDuty. The UI is Next.js 15 with Recharts.

- UI: Next.js 15 App Router + Recharts + server actions
- SDKs supported out of the box: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, vLLM




## Build It

Reconstruct **Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard** by following `Span` on a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2). Run `python3 main.py` and verify that degrees, adjacency, or connectivity expose the isolated/no-edge case explicitly.

## Use It

Call `Span` from a small caller with a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2). Compare its result with the demo output, and record the input contract and the one field a downstream user should rely on.

## Ship It

Hand off `outputs/skill-llm-observability.md` with the command `python3 main.py`, the accepted input shape (a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2)), the expected observable result, and a failure note for malformed inputs.

## Exercises

Work from the smallest fixture that the Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard demo already understands, then make one deliberate change and record what moved.

1. **Run the smallest fixture.** From `code/`, run `python3 main.py` using a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2). Follow `Span`, `is_llm`, `TailSampler`. Expect degrees, adjacency, or connectivity expose the isolated/no-edge case explicitly; capture the first printed shape, metric, status, or summary field and state which part supports **Define measurable acceptance criteria for Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard**.
2. **Perturb one field.** Repeat the command after changing only the edge list: use the same graph with an isolated node 3. Predict the direction of the change, then compare the two output values. Explain why **Integrate the required components into one self-terminating workflow** says the other inputs should stay fixed.
3. **Check the failure boundary.** Feed the implementation a graph with no edges. Before running it, write down whether the relevant function should return an empty value, a zero-sized result, or a validation error. Check the observed status against **Exercise happy paths, edge cases, and failure recovery with reproducible fixtures** and record the exception text if the code rejects the case.
4. **Make the result repeatable.** Open `outputs/skill-llm-observability.md` and add a worked example using a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2). Include the input contract, one expected output field, and a named acceptance check for **Package the verified result as a reusable curriculum artifact**; note what the demo cannot establish.

## Reference Solution

A checkable result for **Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard** should contain:

- the `python3 main.py` output for a graph with edges (0,1) and (1,2), with `Span`, `is_llm`, `TailSampler` traced to the value or shape that supports **Define measurable acceptance criteria for Capstone 11 — LLM Observability & Eval Dashboard**;
- a before/after comparison for the edge list, where the same graph with an isolated node 3 changes the observation in the direction predicted by **Integrate the required components into one self-terminating workflow**;
- a recorded result for a graph with no edges that matches the implementation’s validation or empty-result contract and explains the evidence for **Exercise happy paths, edge cases, and failure recovery with reproducible fixtures**; and
- an updated `outputs/skill-llm-observability.md` example with a concrete input, expected output field, and acceptance check tied to **Package the verified result as a reusable curriculum artifact**.

Run the lesson tests after the demo. If the boundary behaves differently from the prediction, keep the actual exception or output and explain the implementation path that produced it.
