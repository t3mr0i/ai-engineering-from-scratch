# Capstone 13 — MCP Server with Registry and Governance

> The Model Context Protocol stopped being the future and became the default tool-use spec in 2026. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and every major IDE ship MCP clients. Pinterest published its internal ecosystem of MCP servers. The AAIF Registry formalized capability metadata at `.well-known`. AWS ECS published the reference stateless deployment. Block's goose-agent put the same protocol inside a hosted assistant. The 2026 production shape is: StreamableHTTP transport, OAuth 2.1 scopes, OPA policy gating, and a registry that lets platform teams discover, validate, and enable servers. Build that end to end.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 11 (LLM engineering), Phase 13 (tools and MCP), Phase 14 (agents), Phase 17 (infrastructure), Phase 18 (safety)
**Phases exercised:** P11 · P13 · P14 · P17 · P18
**Time:** 25 hours

## Learning Objectives

- Define measurable acceptance criteria for Capstone 13 — MCP Server with Registry and Governance
- Integrate the required components into one self-terminating workflow
- Exercise happy paths, edge cases, and failure recovery with reproducible fixtures
- Package the verified result as a reusable curriculum artifact

## Problem

MCP became the tool-use lingua franca. Claude Code, Cursor 3, Amp, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and every managed agent now consume MCP servers. The production challenges are not authoring servers (FastMCP makes that easy) but deploying them at scale with enterprise requirements: per-tenant OAuth scopes, OPA policy on destructive tools, StreamableHTTP stateless scaling, a registry for discovery, audit logs per tool call. Pinterest's internal MCP ecosystem and the AAIF Registry spec set the 2026 bar.

You will build an MCP server exposing 10 internal tools (Postgres read-only, S3 listing, Jira, Linear, Datadog, etc.), a registry UI for platform discovery, and a human-approval gate for destructive tools. The load test demonstrates StreamableHTTP horizontal scaling. The audit trail satisfies an enterprise security review.

## Concept

MCP 2026 revision mandates StreamableHTTP as the default transport. Unlike the earlier stdio-and-SSE shape, StreamableHTTP is stateless by default: a single HTTP endpoint accepts JSON-RPC requests, streams responses, and supports long-lived connections for notifications. Stateless means horizontally scalable behind a load balancer.

Authorization is OAuth 2.1 with per-tool scopes. A token carries scopes like `jira:read`, `s3:list`, `postgres:query:readonly`. The MCP server checks scopes at tool-call time, not just session start. For high-risk tools, the server rejects any call whose scope is not elevated to `approved:by:human` within the last N minutes — that elevation comes from a Slack review card.

The registry is a separate service. Every MCP server exposes a `.well-known/mcp-capabilities` document with its tool manifest, transport URL, auth requirements. The registry polls, validates, and indexes. Platform teams use the registry UI to see what tools are available, what scopes they need, and which teams own them.

## Stack

- Server framework: FastMCP (Python) or `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript)
- Transport: StreamableHTTP over HTTPS (stateless)
- Auth: OAuth 2.1 with workload identity via SPIFFE / SPIRE
- Policy: OPA / Rego rules per tool; policy decision service per request
- Registry: self-hosted, consumes `.well-known/mcp-capabilities` manifests
- Human approval: Slack interactive message for destructive tools
- Deployment: AWS ECS Fargate or Fly.io, one server per tenant or shared with tenant scoping
- Audit: structured JSONL per-tenant bucket with per-call lineage
