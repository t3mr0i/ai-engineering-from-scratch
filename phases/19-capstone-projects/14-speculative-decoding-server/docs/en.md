# Capstone 14 — Speculative-Decoding Inference Server

> EAGLE-3 in vLLM 0.7 ships 2.5-3x throughput on real traffic. P-EAGLE (AWS 2026) pushed parallel speculation even further. SGLang's SpecForge trained draft heads at scale. Red Hat's Speculators hub published aligned drafts for common open models. TensorRT-LLM made speculative decoding first-class on NVIDIA. The 2026 production serving stack is vLLM or SGLang with EAGLE-family drafts, FP8 or INT4 quantization, and HPA on queue-wait. This capstone is to serve two open models at 2.5x+ baseline throughput with a full tail-latency report.

**Type:** Capstone
**Languages:** Python (serving), C++ / CUDA (kernel inspection), YAML (configs)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 3 (deep learning), Phase 7 (transformers), Phase 10 (LLMs from scratch), Phase 17 (infrastructure)
**Phases exercised:** P3 · P7 · P10 · P17
**Time:** 30 hours

## Problem

Speculative decoding became a commodity in 2026. EAGLE-3 draft heads train on the target model's hidden states and predict N tokens ahead; the target model verifies in a single pass. Acceptance rates of 60-80% translate to 2-3x end-to-end throughput. vLLM 0.7 integrates this natively. SGLang + SpecForge gives you the training pipeline. Red Hat's Speculators publishes aligned drafts for Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen3-Coder-30B MoE, GPT-OSS-120B.

The craft is in the serving operations, not the model. Acceptance rate drifts with the traffic distribution (ShareGPT vs code vs domain data). Tail latency under rejection is worse than without speculation — you must report p99 at multiple batch sizes, not just steady-state tokens/sec. Cost per 1M tokens vs Anthropic / OpenAI API is the credibility lever.

## Concept

Speculative decoding has two layers. A **draft** model (EAGLE-3 head, ngram, or smaller target-aligned model) proposes k candidate tokens per step. The **target** model verifies all k in one pass; any prefix accepted replaces the greedy path. Acceptance rate depends on draft-target alignment and the input distribution.

EAGLE-3 beats ngram drafts on most traffic. P-EAGLE runs parallel speculation for deeper draft trees. The trade-off: P99 latency on rejection is higher because the verify pass is larger. The serving config must report batch-size-bucketed latency to surface this.

Deployment is Kubernetes. vLLM 0.7 runs one replica per GPU or tensor-parallel shard. HPA autoscales on queue-wait rather than CPU. FP8 (Marlin) and INT4 (AWQ) quants keep GPU memory inside an H100 / H200 envelope. The end-to-end report is throughput, acceptance rate, p50/p99 at batch 1/8/32, and $/1M tokens.
