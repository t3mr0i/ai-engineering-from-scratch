# The Full Transformer — Encoder + Decoder

> Attention is the star. Everything else — residuals, normalization, feed-forward, cross-attention — is the scaffolding that lets you stack it deep.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python, Julia
**Prerequisites:** Phase 7 · 02 (Self-Attention), Phase 7 · 03 (Multi-Head Attention), Phase 7 · 04 (Positional Encoding)
**Time:** ~75 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Derive the mechanism behind The Full Transformer — Encoder + Decoder from tensor operations
- Implement the core component without relying on a transformer framework
- Trace tensor shapes and information flow through the implementation
- Evaluate the computational and modeling trade-offs introduced by The Full Transformer — Encoder + Decoder

## The Problem

A single attention layer is a feature extractor, not a model. One matmul per layer is not enough capacity for language. You need depth — and depth breaks without the right plumbing.

The 2017 Vaswani paper packaged six design decisions that turned one attention layer into a stackable block. Every transformer since — encoder-only (BERT), decoder-only (GPT), encoder-decoder (T5) — inherits the same skeleton. In 2026 the blocks have been refined (RMSNorm, SwiGLU, pre-norm, RoPE) but the skeleton is identical.

This lesson is the skeleton. Next lessons specialize it — 06 for encoders, 07 for decoders, 08 for encoder-decoder.

## The Concept

### The six pieces

1. **Embedding + positional signal.** Tokens → vectors. Position injected via RoPE (modern) or sinusoidal (classic).
2. **Self-attention.** Every position attends to every other. Masked in decoders.
3. **Feed-forward network (FFN).** Position-wise two-layer MLP: `W_2 · activation(W_1 · x)`. Expansion ratio 4× by default.
4. **Residual connection.** `x + sublayer(x)`. Without this, gradients vanish past ~6 layers.
5. **Layer normalization.** `LayerNorm` or `RMSNorm` (modern). Stabilizes the residual stream.
6. **Cross-attention (decoder only).** Queries come from the decoder, keys and values from the encoder output.

Watch a vector flow through one block: attention mixes across positions, the residual carries it forward, the FFN transforms it, and norm keeps the stream stable.

### Encoder block (used by BERT, T5 encoder)

```
x → LN → MHA(self) → + → LN → FFN → + → out
                     ^              ^
                     |              |
                     └── residual ──┘
```

Encoder is bidirectional. No masking. All positions see all positions.

### Decoder block (used by GPT, T5 decoder)

```
x → LN → MHA(masked self) → + → LN → MHA(cross to encoder) → + → LN → FFN → + → out
```

Decoder has three sublayers per block. The middle one — cross-attention — is the only place information flows from encoder to decoder. In a pure decoder-only architecture (GPT), cross-attention is omitted and you just have masked self-attention + FFN.

### Pre-norm vs post-norm

Original paper: `x + sublayer(LN(x))` vs `LN(x + sublayer(x))`. Post-norm lost favor around 2019 — it is harder to train deeply without careful warmup. Pre-norm (`LN` *before* sublayer) is the 2026 default: Llama, Qwen, GPT-3+, Mistral all use it.

### The 2026 modernized block

Vaswani 2017 shipped LayerNorm + ReLU. Modern stacks replaced both. What production blocks actually look like:

| Component | 2017 | 2026 |
|-----------|------|------|
| Normalization | LayerNorm | RMSNorm |
| FFN activation | ReLU | SwiGLU |
| FFN expansion | 4× | 2.6× (SwiGLU uses three matrices, total params match) |
| Position | Sinusoidal absolute | RoPE |
| Attention | Full MHA | GQA (or MLA) |
| Bias terms | Yes | No |

RMSNorm drops the mean-centering of LayerNorm (one fewer subtraction), which saves compute and is empirically at least as stable. SwiGLU (`Swish(W1 x) ⊙ W3 x`) consistently outperforms ReLU/GELU FFN by ~0.5 point ppl in the Llama, PaLM and Qwen papers.

### Parameter count

For one block with `d_model = d` and FFN expansion `r`:

- MHA: `4 · d²` (Q, K, V, O projections)
- FFN (SwiGLU): `3 · d · (r · d)` ≈ `3rd²`
- Norms: negligible

At `d = 4096, r = 2.6, layers = 32` (roughly Llama 3 8B), total: `32 · (4·4096² + 3·2.6·4096²) ≈ 32 · (16 + 32) M = ~1.5B parameters per layer × 32 ≈ 7B` (plus embeddings and head). Matches published counts.

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Derive the mechanism behind The Full Transformer — Encoder + Decoder from tensor operations.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Implement the core component without relying on a transformer framework.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Trace tensor shapes and information flow through the implementation.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.py](../code/main.py) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Derive the mechanism behind The Full Transformer — Encoder + Decoder from tensor operations,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Trace tensor shapes and information flow through the implementation,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.

## Guided Demo

Use the [10–15 minute guided demo](demo.md) to predict an invariant, run the canonical entrypoint, change one variable, and probe a failure case.
