# Self-Attention from Scratch

> Attention is a lookup table where every word asks "who matters to me?" - and learns the answer.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Rust, Julia
**Prerequisites:** Phase 3 (Deep Learning Core), Phase 5 Lesson 10 (Sequence-to-Sequence)
**Time:** ~90 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Implement scaled dot-product self-attention from scratch using only NumPy, including query/key/value projections and the softmax-weighted sum
- Build a multi-head attention layer that splits heads, computes parallel attention, and concatenates results
- Trace how the attention matrix captures token relationships and explain why scaling by sqrt(d_k) prevents softmax saturation
- Apply causal masking to convert bidirectional attention into autoregressive (decoder-style) attention

## The Problem

RNNs process sequences one token at a time. By the time you reach token 50, the information from token 1 has been squeezed through 50 compression steps. Long-range dependencies get crushed into a fixed-size hidden state - a bottleneck that no amount of LSTM gating fully solves.

The 2014 Bahdanau attention paper showed the fix: let the decoder look back at every encoder position and decide which ones matter for the current step. But it was still bolted onto an RNN. The 2017 "Attention Is All You Need" paper asked a sharper question: what if attention is the *only* mechanism? No recurrence. No convolution. Just attention.

Self-attention lets every position in a sequence attend to every other position in a single parallel step. That is what makes transformers fast, scalable, and dominant.

## The Concept

### The Database Lookup Analogy

Think of attention as a soft database lookup:

```
Traditional database:
  Query: "capital of France"  -->  exact match  -->  "Paris"

Attention:
  Query: "capital of France"  -->  similarity to ALL keys  -->  weighted blend of ALL values
```

Every token generates three vectors:
- **Query (Q)**: "What am I looking for?"
- **Key (K)**: "What do I contain?"
- **Value (V)**: "What information do I provide if selected?"

The dot product between a query and all keys produces attention scores. High score means "this key matches my query." Those scores weight the values. The output is a weighted sum of values.

### Q, K, V Computation

Each token embedding gets projected through three learned weight matrices:

```
Input embeddings (sequence of n tokens, each d-dimensional):

  X = [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn]       shape: (n, d)

Three weight matrices:

  Wq  shape: (d, dk)
  Wk  shape: (d, dk)
  Wv  shape: (d, dv)

Projections:

  Q = X @ Wq    shape: (n, dk)      each token's query
  K = X @ Wk    shape: (n, dk)      each token's key
  V = X @ Wv    shape: (n, dv)      each token's value
```

Visually, for one token:

```
             Wq
  x_i ------[*]------> q_i    "What am I looking for?"
       |
       |     Wk
       +----[*]------> k_i    "What do I contain?"
       |
       |     Wv
       +----[*]------> v_i    "What do I offer?"
```

### The Attention Matrix

Once you have Q, K, V for all tokens, attention scores form a matrix:

```
Scores = Q @ K^T    shape: (n, n)

              k1    k2    k3    k4    k5
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   q1   | 2.1 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.8 | 0.2 |   <- how much q1 attends to each key
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   q2   | 0.4 | 1.9 | 0.7 | 0.1 | 0.3 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   q3   | 0.2 | 0.6 | 2.3 | 0.5 | 0.1 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   q4   | 0.9 | 0.1 | 0.4 | 1.7 | 0.6 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   q5   | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 2.0 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Each row: one token's attention over the entire sequence
```

Watch one query at a time sweep the keys: each row scores every token, softmax turns the scores into weights, and the context vector is the weighted blend of values.

```

### Why Scale?

The dot products grow with dimension dk. If dk = 64, dot products can be in the range of tens, pushing softmax into regions where gradients vanish. The fix: divide by sqrt(dk).

```
Scaled scores = (Q @ K^T) / sqrt(dk)
```

This keeps values in a range where softmax produces useful gradients.

### Softmax Turns Scores into Weights

Softmax converts raw scores into a probability distribution across each row:

```
Raw scores for q1:   [2.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2]
                            |
                         softmax
                            |
Attention weights:   [0.52, 0.09, 0.07, 0.14, 0.08]   (sums to ~1.0)
```

Now each token has a set of weights saying how much to attend to every other token.

### Weighted Sum of Values

The final output for each token is a weighted sum of all value vectors:

```
output_i = sum( attention_weight[i][j] * v_j  for all j )

For token 1:
  output_1 = 0.52 * v1 + 0.09 * v2 + 0.07 * v3 + 0.14 * v4 + 0.08 * v5
```

Formula in one line:

```

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Implement scaled dot-product self-attention from scratch using only NumPy, including query/key/value projections and the softmax-weighted sum.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Build a multi-head attention layer that splits heads, computes parallel attention, and concatenates results.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Trace how the attention matrix captures token relationships and explain why scaling by sqrt(d_k) prevents softmax saturation.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.rs](../code/main.rs) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Implement scaled dot-product self-attention from scratch using only NumPy, including query/key/value projections and the softmax-weighted sum,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Trace how the attention matrix captures token relationships and explain why scaling by sqrt(d_k) prevents softmax saturation,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.
