# Positional Encoding — Sinusoidal, RoPE, ALiBi

> Attention is permutation-invariant. "The cat sat on the mat" and "mat the on sat cat the" produce the same output without positional signal. Three algorithms fix it — each with a different bet on what "position" means.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 7 · 02 (Self-Attention), Phase 7 · 03 (Multi-Head Attention)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## The Problem

Scaled dot-product attention is order-blind. The attention matrix `softmax(Q K^T / √d) V` is computed from pairwise similarities. Shuffle the rows of `X`, get the rows of the output shuffled the same way. Nothing inside attention cares about position.

That is not a bug in a bag-of-words model. For language, code, audio, video — anything where order carries meaning — it is fatal.

The fix is to inject position into the embeddings somehow. Three eras of answers:

1. **Absolute sinusoidal** (Vaswani 2017). Add `sin/cos` of position to the embedding. Simple, learnable-free, extrapolates poorly beyond trained lengths.
2. **RoPE — Rotary Position Embeddings** (Su 2021). Rotate Q and K vectors by an angle proportional to position. Encodes *relative* position directly in the dot product. Dominant in 2026.
3. **ALiBi — Attention with Linear Biases** (Press 2022). Skip embeddings entirely; add a per-head linear penalty to attention scores based on distance. Excellent length extrapolation.

As of 2026, essentially every frontier open model uses RoPE: Llama 2/3/4, Qwen 2/3, Mistral, Mixtral, DeepSeek-V3, Kimi. A handful of long-context models use ALiBi or its modern variants. Absolute sinusoidal is historical.

## The Concept

![Sinusoidal absolute vs RoPE rotations vs ALiBi distance bias](../assets/positional-encoding.svg)

### Absolute sinusoidal

Pre-compute a fixed matrix `PE` of shape `(max_len, d_model)`:

```
PE[pos, 2i]   = sin(pos / 10000^(2i / d_model))
PE[pos, 2i+1] = cos(pos / 10000^(2i / d_model))
```

Then `X' = X + PE[:N]` before attention. Each dimension is a sinusoid at a different frequency. The model learns to read position from the phase pattern. Fails beyond `max_len`: nothing told the model what happens at position 2048 when it only saw positions 0–2047.

### RoPE

Rotate the Q and K vectors (not embeddings). For a pair of dimensions `(2i, 2i+1)`:

```
[q'_2i    ]   [ cos(pos·θ_i)  -sin(pos·θ_i) ] [q_2i   ]
[q'_2i+1  ] = [ sin(pos·θ_i)   cos(pos·θ_i) ] [q_2i+1 ]

θ_i = base^(-2i / d_head),  base = 10000 by default
```

Apply the same rotation to keys with position `pos_k`. The dot product `q'_m · k'_n` becomes a function of `(m - n)` alone. That is: **the attention score depends only on the relative distance**, even though the rotation was keyed off absolute positions. Beautiful trick.

Extending RoPE: `base` can be scaled (NTK-aware, YaRN, LongRoPE) to extrapolate to longer contexts without retraining. Llama 3 extended from 8K to 128K context this way.

### ALiBi

Skip the embedding trick. Bias the attention scores directly:

```
attn_score[i, j] = (q_i · k_j) / √d  -  m_h · |i - j|
```

Where `m_h` is a head-specific slope (e.g. `1 / 2^(8·h/H)`). Closer tokens get boosted; far tokens get penalized. No training-time cost. The paper shows length extrapolation beats sinusoidal and matches RoPE on its original trained length.

### What to pick in 2026

| Variant | Extrapolation | Training cost | Used by |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Absolute sinusoidal | poor | free | original transformer, early BERT |
| Learned absolute | none | tiny | GPT-2, GPT-3 |
| RoPE | good with scaling | free | Llama 2/3/4, Qwen 2/3, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3, Kimi |
| RoPE + YaRN | excellent | fine-tune stage | Qwen2-1M, Llama 3.1 128K |
| ALiBi | excellent | free | BLOOM, MPT, Baichuan |

RoPE won because it slots into attention without changing the architecture, encodes relative position, and its `base` hyperparameter gives a clean knob for long-context fine-tuning.
