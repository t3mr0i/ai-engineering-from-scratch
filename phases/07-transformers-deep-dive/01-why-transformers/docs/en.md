## The Problem

Before 2017, every state-of-the-art sequence model on the planet — language, translation, speech — was a recurrent neural network. LSTMs and GRUs won ImageNet-equivalent translation benchmarks for half a decade. They were the only tool anyone had.

They had three fatal weaknesses. Sequential computation meant you could not parallelize along the time axis: token `t+1` needs the hidden state from token `t`. A 1,024-token sequence meant 1,024 serial steps on a GPU that can do 1,000,000 floating-point ops per cycle. Training wall-clock time scaled linearly with sequence length on hardware designed for parallelism.

Vanishing gradients meant information 50 tokens back was already compressed through 50 non-linearities. Gated recurrent units (LSTM, GRU) softened the crush but never eliminated it. Long-range dependencies — "the book I read last summer on a plane to Kyoto was…" — routinely failed.

Fixed-width hidden states meant the encoder squeezed the entire source sequence into a single vector before the decoder saw anything. Doesn't matter if the source is 5 tokens or 500; the bottleneck is the same shape.

The 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" proposed something radical: drop recurrence entirely. Let every position attend to every other position in parallel. Train in one big matrix multiplication instead of 1,024 sequential ones.

The result dominates every modality by 2026. Language (GPT-5, Claude 4, Llama 4), vision (ViT, DINOv2, SAM 3), audio (Whisper), biology (AlphaFold 3), robotics (RT-2). Same block, different inputs.

## The Concept

![RNN sequential compute vs Transformer parallel attention](../assets/rnn-vs-transformer.svg)

**Recurrence as a bottleneck.** An RNN computes `h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t)`. Each step depends on the previous. You cannot compute `h_5` before `h_4`. On modern GPUs with 10,000+ parallel cores, this wastes 99% of the silicon on a long sequence.

**Attention as a broadcast.** Self-attention computes `output_i = sum_j(a_ij * v_j)` for every pair `(i, j)` simultaneously. The whole N×N attention matrix fills in one batched matmul. No step depends on another. GPUs love it.

**The speedup is not a constant.** It is the difference between `O(N)` serial depth and `O(1)` serial depth. In practice, transformers train 5–10× faster per epoch on matched hardware at N=512, and the gap widens with sequence length until you hit the `O(N²)` memory wall of attention (which Flash Attention later fixed — see "KV Cache, Flash Attention & Inference Optimization" later in this phase).

**What transformers cost.** Attention memory scales as `O(N²)`. For 2K context, fine. For 128K context, you need sliding windows, RoPE extrapolation, Flash Attention tiling, or linear attention variants. Recurrence was `O(N)` in both time and memory; transformers trade time for memory and then win the time back through parallelism.

**The inductive bias shift.** RNNs assume locality and recency. Transformers assume nothing — every pair is a candidate for attention. That is why transformers need more data to train well but scale further once they have it. Chinchilla (2022) formalized this: given enough tokens, a transformer always beats an RNN of equal parameter count.

## Exercises

1. **Establish a baseline.** Run the lesson demo, then capture the inputs, outputs, and one invariant that demonstrates this objective: Derive the mechanism behind Why Transformers — The Problems with RNNs from tensor operations.
2. **Change one variable.** Modify a single input or parameter and use the resulting evidence to investigate this objective: Implement the core component without relying on a transformer framework.
3. **Probe an edge case.** Predict the result before running it, compare prediction with observation, and explain the discrepancy while applying this objective: Trace tensor shapes and information flow through the implementation.

## Reference Solution

Use the canonical [main.py](../code/main.py) as the executable baseline. A complete solution records a successful run, identifies the invariant tied to “Derive the mechanism behind Why Transformers — The Problems with RNNs from tensor operations,” and changes only one variable for the comparison. The edge-case result must distinguish the prediction from the observation, explain the cause using “Trace tensor shapes and information flow through the implementation,” and cite a repeatable check rather than relying on visual inspection alone.
