# Why Transformers — The Problems with RNNs

> RNNs process tokens one at a time. Transformers process all tokens at once. That single architectural bet changed every scaling curve in deep learning after 2017.

## The Problem

Before 2017, every state-of-the-art sequence model on the planet — language, translation, speech — was a recurrent neural network. LSTMs and GRUs won ImageNet-equivalent translation benchmarks for half a decade. They were the only tool anyone had.

They had three fatal weaknesses. Sequential computation meant you could not parallelize along the time axis: token `t+1` needs the hidden state from token `t`. A 1,024-token sequence meant 1,024 serial steps on a GPU that can do 1,000,000 floating-point ops per cycle. Training wall-clock time scaled linearly with sequence length on hardware designed for parallelism.

Vanishing gradients meant information 50 tokens back was already compressed through 50 non-linearities. Gated recurrent units (LSTM, GRU) softened the crush but never eliminated it. Long-range dependencies — "the book I read last summer on a plane to Kyoto was…" — routinely failed.

Fixed-width hidden states meant the encoder squeezed the entire source sequence into a single vector before the decoder saw anything. Doesn't matter if the source is 5 tokens or 500; the bottleneck is the same shape.

The 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" proposed something radical: drop recurrence entirely. Let every position attend to every other position in parallel. Train in one big matrix multiplication instead of 1,024 sequential ones.

The result dominates every modality by 2026. Language (GPT-5, Claude 4, Llama 4), vision (ViT, DINOv2, SAM 3), audio (Whisper), biology (AlphaFold 3), robotics (RT-2). Same block, different inputs.

## The Concept

![RNN sequential compute vs Transformer parallel attention](../assets/rnn-vs-transformer.svg)

**Recurrence as a bottleneck.** An RNN computes `h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t)`. Each step depends on the previous. You cannot compute `h_5` before `h_4`. On modern GPUs with 10,000+ parallel cores, this wastes 99% of the silicon on a long sequence.

**Attention as a broadcast.** Self-attention computes `output_i = sum_j(a_ij * v_j)` for every pair `(i, j)` simultaneously. The whole N×N attention matrix fills in one batched matmul. No step depends on another. GPUs love it.

**The speedup is not a constant.** It is the difference between `O(N)` serial depth and `O(1)` serial depth. In practice, transformers train 5–10× faster per epoch on matched hardware at N=512, and the gap widens with sequence length until you hit the `O(N²)` memory wall of attention (which Flash Attention later fixed — see Lesson 12).

**What transformers cost.** Attention memory scales as `O(N²)`. For 2K context, fine. For 128K context, you need sliding windows, RoPE extrapolation, Flash Attention tiling, or linear attention variants. Recurrence was `O(N)` in both time and memory; transformers trade time for memory and then win the time back through parallelism.

**The inductive bias shift.** RNNs assume locality and recency. Transformers assume nothing — every pair is a candidate for attention. That is why transformers need more data to train well but scale further once they have it. Chinchilla (2022) formalized this: given enough tokens, a transformer always beats an RNN of equal parameter count.


## Use It

When to still pick an RNN in 2026:

| Situation | Pick |
|-----------|------|
| Streaming inference, one token at a time, constant memory | RNN or state-space model (Mamba, RWKV) |
| Very long sequences (>1M tokens) where attention memory explodes | Linear attention, Mamba 2, Hyena |
| Edge device with no matmul accelerator | Depthwise-separable RNN still wins on FLOPs/watt |
| Anything else (training, batched inference, context up to 128K) | Transformer |

State-space models (SSMs) like Mamba are essentially RNNs with structured parameterization that gives them the best of both: `O(N)` scan memory, parallel training via selective scan. They recover 90% of transformer quality with better long-context scaling. In 2026 most frontier labs train hybrid SSM+transformer models (e.g. Jamba, Samba) — recurrence is not dead, it is a component.

## Ship It

See `outputs/skill-architecture-picker.md`. The skill picks an architecture for a new sequence problem given length, throughput, and training-budget constraints. It should always refuse to recommend a pure RNN for training runs above 1B tokens without stating the trade-off.


## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Recurrence | "RNNs are sequential" | Computation where step `t` depends on step `t-1`, forcing serial execution along the time axis. |
| Serial depth | "How deep the graph is" | Longest chain of dependent ops; bounds wall-clock even on infinite hardware. |
| Attention | "Let tokens look at each other" | Weighted sum `sum_j a_ij v_j` where `a_ij` comes from a similarity score between positions i and j. |
| Context window | "How much the model sees" | Number of positions an attention layer can take as input; quadratic memory cost scales here. |
| Inductive bias | "Assumptions baked into the architecture" | Prior about what the data looks like; CNNs assume translation invariance, RNNs assume recency. |
| State-space model | "RNN with algebra behind it" | Recurrence parameterized for parallel training via structured state-space matrices. |
| Quadratic bottleneck | "Why context costs so much" | Attention memory = `O(N²)` in sequence length; Flash Attention hides the constants, not the scaling. |
